                    <h2>Pisces Zodiac Sign Traits</h2>

                    <p>Smart, creative, and deeply intuitive, Pisces can be close to psychic. Pisces feel things deeply,
                        and have incredibly strong gut reactions. A Pisces "knows" things from deep within, and can
                        often judge whether a person or situation is good or bad. That doesn't mean a Pisces ignores the
                        logical part of their brain, though. Deeply intelligent, Pisces have a profound respect for the
                        power of the human mind. Is it a surprise that Albert Einstein was a Pisces?
                    </p>

                    <p>Pisces signs are sensitive, and get along well in small groups of people. Sometimes, a Pisces may
                        feel like they have an internal and external self, and they may need to spend a lot of time solo
                        to recalibrate those two halves of themselves. A Pisces is rarely lonely when they are by
                        themselves, and have an active imagination. Creative, Pisces love spending time reading,
                        exploring or creating art or music, and understanding their emotions through art.</p>

                    <p>Those with the Pisces sign may seem quiet but they are incredibly strong and have a very strong
                        sense of right and wrong. Their moral compass, along with their gut, guides them well. When a
                        Pisces speaks up, people listen. Pisces tend to take in everything around them, and they are
                        great people to ask for advice on pretty much anything. While Pisces has strong convictions
                        about the best way for them to live, they have a "live and let live" approach when it comes to
                        others, and are accepting and nonjudgmental of all.</p>

        <div class="facts">
            <div class="nocenter">
                <h2>Friendship Compatibilty</h2>
                <p>A Pisces can feel like a great friend—until you consider how much you actually know about them. While
                    Pisces are natural therapists within the Zodiac, they can be cagey about who they are, never
                    revealing their full selves until they trust you—and sometimes, they may never reveal who they truly
                    are. A Pisces can sometimes seem chilly and reserved to acquaintances, and it may seem hard to pull
                    them out of their shell.</p>

                <p>Pisces are loyal, but their ultimate loyalty is to themselves. They will only give people in their
                    lives so many chances, and they will not sacrifice their health and well-being for that of someone
                    else. A Pisces makes their terms clear, and will always be who they are in a friendship situation.
                    This can be maddening—for example, a Pisces won't play nice and head to a restaurant for another
                    friend's birthday dinner if she hates that restaurant or feels like she's been wronged there—but
                    remember: It's not personal.</p>

                <p>A Pisces is well-liked, well-cultured, and brings a unique perspective to every interaction. Pisces
                    likes people and likes gatherings, but may sometimes feel exhausted by large gatherings. One on one
                    gatherings or intimate groups—even if the conversations get intense—are preferable to Pisces. A
                    Pisces honors childhood friendships, and even if they feel they've grown apart from their earlier
                    friends, will still find ways to keep in touch—as long as that friend doesn't try to make them
                    abandon their principles.</p>

        <div class="facts">
            <div class="nocenter">
                <h2>Love Compatibilty</h2>
                <p>Pisces in love is passionate, intense, and singular. A relationship with a Pisces is a roller-coaster
                    ride that will make you feel your feelings—even the bad ones—and help you emerge as a better, more
                    honest person. Even if a relationship with a Pisces doesn't last, the lessons you learn from a
                    Pisces partner will.</p>

                <p>A Pisces will go all-in when it comes to romance, and expects their partner to do the same. It's not
                    as if a Pisces is clingy—on the contrary, a Pisces can seem incredibly independent while in a
                    relationship—but a Pisces constantly views the world as if from a split-screen: The world through
                    their eyes, and the world through their partner's eyes. They're always trying to make the choices
                    that are the best for both parties, and even small decisions, like where to order Seamless, are made
                    with that perspective in mind.</p>

                <p>A Pisces wants their partner to grow, and demands that their partner brings their very best self to
                    the relationship. That may cause some partners to feel like they're being pushed away, as a Pisces
                    partner will likely say of course they should seek a promotion, more time at the gym, or a goal,
                    even if it means spending time apart.</p>

                <p>For Pisces, the physical, spiritual, and intellectual are deeply intertwined, and in relationships,
                    physicality is an important manifestation of love. Pisces can be incredibly sensual when they're
                    feeling deeply in love, but isn't a sign that ever fakes anything. Pisces demands full presence in a
                    relationship, and is especially hurt by any sort of deception. A Pisces demands full honesty and
                    gives the same in return.</p>

                <h2>Love Matches</h2>
                <p><span class="gold">Virgo:</span> This grounding earth sign can stop Pisces from getting too mired in
                    their emotions, and can give Pisces the stability and "island anchor" the sign may feel they need.
                    Virgo finds strength in the deep, abiding acceptance Pisces brings to the partnership. When things
                    are working between these two, they bring out the best in each other. Because both Pisces and Virgo
                    are mutable signs, they tend to be accepting of each other and find little to argue about.</p>

                <p><span class="gold">Scorpio:</span> Scorpio brings heat and passion to Pisces watery depths, and,
                    Pisces, as a fellow water sign, can get underneath Scorpio's surface in a way few other Zodiac signs
                    can. This match can seem stormy, but these two signs are good at weathering the challenges of a
                    relationship, and both can fight during the day—and end up entwined in each other's arms by night.
                </p>

                <p><span class="gold">Pisces:</span> Who better to understand a fish than a fellow fish? This
                    partnership can seem to develop like the moon—faint to see at first, only to be powerful and
                    luminescent a few days later. Pisces respect each other's space and know each other's needs, and
                    together, the pair can be incredibly powerful.</p>

        <div class="facts">
            <div class="nocenter">
                <p><span class="gold">Best Gifts:</span> ewelry. Not just any necklace, but a necklace, bracelet, or
                    ring with meaning is important to Pisces, who sees jewelry as talisman for them, and likes having
                    jewelry to anchor them to people, a goal, or a memory.</p>

                <p><span class="gold">Best Spa Package:</span> A watsu massage. A massage that takes place in water?
                    Sign any Pisces up. This massage therapy can make people feel like they're back in the womb, and is
                    especially meaningful to water sign Pisces.</p>

                <p><span class="gold">Best Cocktail:</span> A spiked seltzer. For Pisces, less can be more, and a Pisces
                    may decline a drink. It's not that they don't want to have fun, it's that chemicals can affect their
                    brains and bodies in powerful ways. A spiked seltzer with a low alcohol content can help get the
                    party started for a Pisces without pushing them over the edge.</p>

                <h2>Social Life</h2>
                <p>Pisces has their pick of friends, but tends to prefer a small group. In general, Pisces prefer
                    one-on-one or intimate gatherings to parties, and find that their energy can easily drain if they
                    have too many social engagements planned back to back. A Pisces is great at coming up with fun
                    ideas, and can breathe new life into the same old dinner routine, just by implementing a new
                    rule—only dessert items—or bringing interesting conversation topics to the mix.</p>

                <h2>Best Vacations</h2>
                <p>Moody, mysterious, plenty of time to talk about the mysteries of life under the covers, and a
                    built-in "weather's too bad, sorry!" excuse to not go out on weekends? Bring on winter. Pisces can
                    find beauty in even the coldest days, and loves how winter gives them time to pause, reflex, and
                    look below the surface.</p>

                <h2>Favorite Season</h2>
                <p>Moody, mysterious, plenty of time to talk about the mysteries of life under the covers, and a
                    built-in "weather's too bad, sorry!" excuse to not go out on weekends? Bring on winter. Pisces can
                    find beauty in even the coldest days, and loves how winter gives them time to pause, reflex, and
                    look below the surface.</p>

        <div class="facts">
            <div class="nocenter">
                <p><span class="gold">Ailments:</span> Need a tissue? Pisces are known to struggle with sinus issues and
                    their bodies aren't great at going through seasonal changes. Make sure to always have a jacket on
                    hand during transition seasons and pay attention to the air quality in your home.</p>
                <p><span class="gold">Strengths:</span> Pisces knows that their mind and body are connected, and they
                    treat mental health issues as seriously as physical health issues. By staying on top of their
                    emotions and learning ways to cope with any stressors, Pisces can feel better in their mind, body,
                    and spirit.</p>
                <p><span class="gold">Weaknesses:</span>
                    Sometimes, Pisces may be distrustful of doctors or may truly think that any physical ailment can be
                    solved with a positive attitude. Finding a doctor you trust and making sure you voice any concerns
                    regarding medication will help keep you healthy.</p>

                <h2>Fitness Routines</h2>
                <p>Aqua Zumba. Not only is this dance class in your second home, the pool, but the water takes down some of the heat of the workout and makes it fun. Not only that, but you'll dig the camaraderie and find plenty of workout buddies on the same page as you.
                </p>

                <h2>About Foot Issues</h2>
                <p>Pisces rule the feet, and small and large issues can bring a Pisces to the podiatrist's office throughout his or her life. Pisces doesn't like to be constricted, and shoes can be a metaphor for how Pisces feel in the roles they must play in the world. They may feel constricted or uncomfortable. The advice find shoes that fit may sound simple, but it may behoove Pisces to take that advice seriously—and find plenty of places and times they can kick their shoes off and feel free. And pay attention to how your feet feel—getting prompt and proactive care can help you feel more comfortable on both a physical and psychological level.</p>

                <h2>Healing Herbs for Intensity</h2>
                <p><span class="gold">European Hornbeam:</span> European hornbeam buds extract helps Pisces to expectorate, to soothe a whooping coughing produced by bronchitis they are prone to.
                </p>
                <p><span class="gold">Ash:</span> Ash can help Pisces eliminate toxins, one of their major problems, but also eliminate excess water from the tissues (edema). The property of ash bark tea to reduce fever has been known since ancient times, and Pisces seems to react particularly well to this remedy.</p>
                <p><span class="gold">Elm:</span> Elm bark makes a healing decoction that can be used to fight certain common Pisces health problems, namely respiratory issues, cough, ascites, pleurisy, and insomnia. Elm-based ointments work effectively against eczema.</p>
                <p><span class="gold">Black Mulberry:</span> Can be a suitable remedy for Pisces suffering from diabetes, but the dosage should be recommended by a herbalist.</p>
                <p><span class="gold">Elm:</span> In Ayurvedic medicine, some of the most healing herbs for Pisces are algae, elecampane, borage, and stone moss.</p>

        <div class="facts">
            <div class="nocenter">
                <h2>Work Style</h2>
                <p>The idea of working in an open-plan office with set hours can make the skin of a Pisces crawl, and because of that, Pisces are much more suited to artistic, entrepreneurial, or vocational endeavors. A Pisces has a strong work ethic, but only when a Pisces believes the work is worth doing. You'll never catch a Pisces staying at the office late just for optics, and a Pisces may need to learn to play by corporate rules for long-term success.</p>

                <p>Pisces can work solo, and loves getting completely wrapped up in a project at hand. Money isn't necessarily important to Pisces, but they do appreciate creature comforts, and they also appreciate the respect and visibility that money and a title can bring. A Pisces does not want their work to be ignored, and a Pisces will get resentful if a boss doesn't notice and reward a job well done.</p>

                <p>Pisces may have several careers in their life. They realize that nothing is permanent, and also realize that the right career can help lead them to happiness. When a Pisces realizes a certain path is no longer working, they don't consider it a waste to start from the bottom in a new industry or to go back to school. Pisces sees their career path as being one more way to learn and evolve.</p>

                <h2>Money</h2>
                <p>A Pisces can find—and lose—money easily, and may feel like reputation or recognition is far more important than a paycheck. A Pisces can be careless with the money they do have. It's not uncommon for a Pisces to frequently lose their debit or credit card, or to not bother to invoice for payment. A Pisces' sense of self-worth is independent of what they make.</p>

                <p>But of course, a Pisces is no stranger to reality, and knows that having money can ward off uncertainty and insecurity. Pisces has a deep confidence in their resourcefulness skills, and doesn't second guess themselves when it comes to applying for jobs—even those that they may not be qualified for. A Pisces also recognizes that they have weak spots when it comes to finances, and often employs a professional to help walk them through financial admin, so they can focus more on their work.</p>
