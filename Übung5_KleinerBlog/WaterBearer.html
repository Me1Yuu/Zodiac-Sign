                    <h2>Aquarius Zodiac Sign Traits</h2>

                    <p>Independent and enigmatical, Aquarians are unique. There is no one quite like an Aquarius, and
                        because each is so incredibly individual, it can be tough to describe them as a group. Aquarians
                        don't like labels, and may shy away from any adjective—even the good ones you might bestow upon
                        them. Aquarians believe in the nature of change and evolution, and even though they're a fixed
                        sign, they may not necessarily believe they are the "same" people they were when they were born.
                    </p>

                    <p>Aquarians have a strong sense of social justice and making the world a better place, and see
                        themselves as just one link in an endless human chain. They are very concerned about others, not
                        because of how others treat them or how they want others to treat them.</p>

                <h2>Friendship Compatibilty</h2>
                <p>Aquarius will always take the initiative to meet someone and hear their story. Aquarians love finding connections to other people, and never feel self-conscious or out of place, even in a group of strangers. Good listeners and natural questioners, Aquarians can draw out anyone, getting a new acquaintance to tell an Aquarian things they've barely told anyone else before. But there is another side: Aquarius can be very private, and people think they know an Aquarius much better than they do. Aquarius likes having a large social circle, but cultivating close friends takes time and trust. Aquarius takes disappointment in friendships seriously, and takes it hard—a cancelled coffee meet-up won't make an Aquarius hold a grudge, but it will be a long time (if ever) they'll invite you closer into their social circle. Aquarians see the best in people, but get frustrated if people don't see those qualities in themselves. Aquarius sometimes feels like they always have to be the cheerleader and mentor for others, and sometimes crave another person to play that role in their lives. Aquarians are fun-loving, up for anything, and always feel that a friend is just a person you haven't met yet.</p>

            <div class="nocenter">
                <h2>Love Compatibilty</h2>
                <p>Aquarius in love may march to the beat of their own drummer—the free-love era wasn't named "The Age of Aquarius" for nothing. Aquarius doesn't take a lot of stock in what "should" be done, but Aquarius has their own rules, codes of ethics, and morality and takes all three incredibly seriously.</p>

                <p>Aquarius may be skittish when it comes to love. While they enjoy flirtatious relationships and can easily be in a longterm "friends with benefits" situation, love—even when they have deep feelings for the other person—can lead them to feel trapped or scared of the future. An Aquarius doesn't want to depend on another person, and they don't want someone else to depend on them. Trying to navigate healthy codependence in a relationship is a lifelong Aquarius challenge.</p>

                <p>Aquarius is physically passionate, honest, and very in tune with their sexuality. An Aquarius may find sex connects them more deeply to themselves, as well as their partner, and believes that sex can exist outside of love.</p>

                <p>An Aquarius cares deeply about their partner, but believes that love is not asking another person to put the other person's needs ahead of their own. An Aquarius in love isn't selfish, they're pragmatic, and they're doing what's most honest for them.</p>

                <h2>Love Matches</h2>
                <p><span class="gold">Gemini:</span> These two air signs are intelligent, fun, and occasionally derided as quirky by other members of the Zodiac. This pair connects well on a physical level, while also giving each other the psychological space they sometimes need.</p>

                <p><span class="gold">Aquarius:</span> Fellow Aquarians respect and love what each other brings to the table. They don't take the need for independence personally, understand that love may take time to build, and have a pretty amazing carnal connection.</p>

                <p><span class="gold">Sagittarius:</span> Fire sign Sag can add some heat to ethereal Aquarius, and may even make Aquarius commit to love. Both adventurers, both independent, and both very sure of what they want, Sags and Aquarians can bring out the best in each other—if they don't drive each other crazy first.</p>

        <div class="facts">
            <div class="nocenter">
                <p><span class="gold">Best Gifts:</span> A backpack or passport holder. Aquarians are minimalists and adventurers, so you want something that they'll use.</p>

                <p><span class="gold">Best Spa Package:</span> A float tank session. Aquarians love trying new things, and feel like floating in a dark tank is a quiet way to unwind and finally hear themselves think.</p>

                <p><span class="gold">Best Cocktail:</span> Margarita on the rocks, hold the salt. Aquarius is a purist, and doesn't like when fancy purees or flavors mess with a classic.</p>

                <h2>Social Life</h2>
                <p>Aquarius has a huge group of friends—and even more people who want to be their friends. Aquarius doesn't take stock in cliques or groups, and is the type to float between different social circles. While Aquarius can always find their place in a crowd, it can be tough to get into the inner circle of an Aquarius. Aquarius likes their privacy, and also doesn't want to get too close to someone until they truly know they can trust them, inside and out. Aquarius also values their personal time and bristles at mandatory social engagements. When an Aquarius comes to your party, it means they want to be there. When they don't come, don't take it personally. It doesn't mean they don't like you, it just means that they only want to come when their energy is positive.</p>

                <h2>Best Vacations</h2>
                <p>Aquarians love trying new things, so you're unlikely to find an Aquarius at the same resort year after year. Aquarius likes sporty, active vacations, and are happy to go somewhere where their clothes and backpacks are going to get a little dirty. Aquarians won't turn down a nice meal, but they're happy buying food off the street or scouring the grocery store for the ingredients locals use. An Aquarius also uses their large social circle as impetus to visit far-flung friends around the globe.</p>

                <h2>Favorite Season</h2>
                <p>Aquarius thrives in the winterï¿½it is there birthday season, after all—and finds the adage "there's no bad weather, only bad clothing" perfectly reflects their view on life. They love bundling up in the cold, taking part in winter sports, and cozying up in front of the fire. They also know that beauty can be found even in the wettest sleet storm, and don't feel like they need a warm summer day to put them in a good mood.</p>

            <div class="nocenter">
                <p><span class="gold">Ailments:</span> Skip the stilettos! Ruled by the ankles and shins, Aquarians are prone to leg issues and injuries. Varicose veins and heart ailments may also become a problem down the line.</p>
                <p><span class="gold">Strengths:</span> Aquarians believe in doctors, but also believe in new age practices. Their ability to believe, and ability to truly connect their mind and body, can be beneficial to healing.</p>
                <p><span class="gold">Weaknesses:</span>
                    Sometimes, Aquarians forget that health issues can truly have a physical reason behind it, and may try "wishing things well" instead of consulting with a doctor.</p>

                <h2>Fitness Routines</h2>
                <p>Group training. Whether it's training for a marathon or a triathlon, the social element will keep you coming back—and getting stronger.
                </p>

                <h2>About Ankle Issues</h2>
                <p>Hey Water-Bearers, it's time to talk about all that weight you're carrying around. While you seem to let issues roll off your back, you sometimes let things—mental or physical—keep irritating you. This is especially true when it comes to physical issues. You're a grin and bear it type of person, but sometimes, it's okay to admit something hurts. You're always the first to volunteer to lift the heaviest suitcase, to carry the biggest box, to never, ever give up. But your body has limits. Respecting your body and how much it can take will go a long way in making sure your body stays healthy for years to come.</p>

                <h2>Healing Herbs for Intensity</h2>
                <p><span class="gold">Comfrey:</span> Used for sprains, strains, and wound care, this herb may help heal any Aquarius ankle accidents.
                </p>
                <p><span class="gold">Valerian:</span> This calming herb can (finally!) calm the racing mind of an Aquarius.</p>
                <p><span class="gold">Violet:</span> This anti-inflammatory herb can be a good antidote to the go-go-go lifestyle of an Aquarius.</p>

                <h2>Work Style</h2>
                <p>Relying on instinct, Aquarius has a good sense of how pieces of a project lay out. They know what they need to do, but they may have a hard time explaining their vision to others. Aquarius likes to follow their own internal clock and rhythm to get a job done. Sometimes, they might stay up all night, but sometimes, they want to work from nine to five.</p>

                <p>An Aquarius goes with the flow when it comes to the structure of their work day, and does well working remotely or working for a company that looks at product over time spent at a desk.</p>

                <p>Aquarius is a popular employee who knows how to get along with everyone. They may not like the political rules governing an office, but they can play to them almost effortlessly. They know that being nice at work makes the office more pleasant for everyone, and they take their work quality of life seriously.</p>

                <h2>Money</h2>
                <p>Aquarius may feel "money doesn't matter," but that's only because they're good at making it. For Aquarius, money is a tool that can help them live a life they love—it's not necessarily a power symbol, and more isn't always better.</p>

                <p>Aquarius believes that money can be a tool for good or evil, and is conscious of how their spending impacts the world at large. They may be especially interested in ethical purchases or ethical investing, and may be frustrated when people become consumed with the number on their paycheck.</p>

                <p>Aquarius is good with numbers, and a quick mind and captivating imagination can make them savvy investors who may "see" trends in the market others can't.</p>
                
                <p>Aquarius believes money comes and goes, but relationships stay, and tend to make investing in relationships a priority over investing in their career or investing in the stock market.</p>
