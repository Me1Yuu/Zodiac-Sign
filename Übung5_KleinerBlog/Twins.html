                    <h2>Gimini Zodiac Sign Traits</h2>
    
                    <p>Smart, passionate, and dynamic, Gemini is characterized by the Twins, Castor and Pollux, and is known
                        for having two different sides they can display to the world. Expert communicators, Gemini is the
                        chameleon of the Zodiac, adept at blending into different groups based on the vibe and energy they
                        perceive. While they're also amazing at showcasing surface traits, the Gemini well runs deep, which
                        is why the Twins are one of the Zodiac's most emotionally intelligent signs.</p>
    
                    <p>Energetic and quick-witted, Gemini never gets stuck in the past and doesn't ruminate on what might
                        have been. Instead, they move forward with glass-half-full optimism and an ability to always look on
                        the bright side—and land on their feet—in nearly any situation. With a mind that's constantly
                        racing, even when they're just quietly hanging out, the Twins never get bored. In fact, Gemini are
                        happy keeping their own company, and can often turn their solitary daydreams into reality.</p>
    
                    <p>Gemini signs are in love with love, and they adore the ritual of it all, from those "do they like
                        me?" butterflies to the anticipation of a back-and-forth text volley. Gemini loves dating, and the
                        world loves Gemini. But a Gemini will eventually settle down, because this sign is incredibly loyal
                        and steadfast once they've chosen a partner. Let's be clear, though: Steadfast isn't a code word for
                        boring. Gemini always love to keep things fresh and are happy to try almost anything in the bedroom.
                        They're proud of their sexuality and depend on frequent physical check-ins to keep them grounded in
                        their body. To them, sex is a celebration of life, and Gemini loves both sex and life.</p>
    
                    <p>Despite their unfair rep for being two-faced, once a Gemini is in your life, they're loyal for
                        life—but they aren't afraid to voice their opinion if they feel you're doing something they disagree
                        with or if they perceive you as not being loyal to them. Always a sign to see all sides of the
                        situation, Gemini may seek input from friends before going to the root of the problem. It's not
                        gossiping—it's gathering information.</p>
    
                    <p>And even though Gemini is easily the life of the party without trying, the Twins also have a deep
                        emotional side that needs care and feeding. Gemini like time by themselves to read, create,
                        daydream, and come up with other ways of sharing their gifts with the world. When a Gemini can truly
                        tap in and share their gifts, they're an unstoppable force of energy that can motivate, inspire, and
                        enchant the rest of the Zodiac.</p>

                <h2>Friendship Compatibilty</h2>
                <p>The bad news: Gemini will forget your birthday or flake on a date that you set in the calendar months
                    ago. The good news: It's not personal, and your Gemini friend will make it up to you. Funny, witty, and
                    talking a mile a minute, a Gemini will keep you laughing, and it's likely that some of your best
                    memories involve a Gemini. The Twins can infuse drama and intrigue into even the most same-old-sounding
                    coffee date, and they may surprise you by ordering your lattes in a foreign accent or requesting some
                    custom-made concoction dreamed up in their head. Even though Gemini have tons of friends and their
                    calendar gets packed months out, when they're with you, you're the only person that matters. But even
                    though you may think your Gemini friend knows you well, it may take longer for you to get to know them.
                    Gemini love connecting to people, yet they can guard their own selves and personalities from others.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <input type="radio" id="love" name="tabs">
        <label for="love">Love</label>
        <div class="facts">
            <div class="nocenter">
                <h2>Love Compatibilty</h2>
                <p>Dynamic, intense, and with so many shifting parts to their personalities, Gemini love to date. Indeed,
                    they consider dating a skill. Gemini are great at drawing first dates out of their shells, and they
                    rarely have a "bad" date—because this optimism-infused sign will always finds something positive about
                    the person they meet or the conversation they shared.</p>
    
                <p>But even though dating is fun, it can be hard for Gemini to take the next step. While the Twins love the
                    idea of love, they're also passionate about their own independence, and they want to make sure that they
                    aren't giving anything up before taking the next step. And while Gemini aren't dishonest, their ruling
                    planet Mercury makes them especially adept at telling others what they want to hear—which some might
                    perceive as leading people on.</p>
    
                <p>Gemini aren't bound by convention. If they find themselves partnering with someone isn't the "type" that
                    their friends or family would have expected, well, Gemini just don't care. Once in love, Gemini aren't
                    afraid to make their own rules (with their partner of course) about what the relationship looks like.
                </p>
    
                <p>In bed, Gemini is dynamic, intense, and wants to experience as much as possible. Sensation play—think wax
                    and ice—is a welcome try for a Gemini. And of course, the Twins can't resist contrasts, even in bed.
                    Whether they're exploring quickies or all-day lovemaking marathons, taking the lead or being totally
                    passive, or playing around with different roles and sensations during sex, a Gemini is never bored.</p>
    
                <h2>Love Matches</h2>
                <p><span class="gold">Aries:</span> Fiery, intense, and passionate, this fire sign is a lustful match for
                    Gemini—if both signs decide to settle down. Fiercely guarding their independence, these two signs have a
                    live and let live approach that could make their romance unconventional. Honest Aries can help ground
                    Gemini, and the two signs may go through a stormy period before settling into a remarkably stable match
                    for the long haul.</p>
    
                <p><span class="gold">Leo:</span> Proud, passionate, and confident, a Leo will woo a Gemini—only if the
                    Gemini works just as hard to woo the Leo. Both signs appreciate the ritual of romance, and they love
                    dates, flowers, and long, gushing letters. As the relationship progresses, both signs will find an
                    intellectual equal in each other, and they'll discover that they can let their guard down in ways that
                    they rarely do with others.</p>
    
                <p><span class="gold">Libra:</span> This cardinal sign has the ambition to nudge Gemini out of excessive
                    daydreaming. Honest above all else, Libras can help ground Gemini when they seem too flighty. They're
                    also not afraid to call Gemini out when they seem to be playing a part. Libra appreciates all aspects of
                    Gemini's personality, but wants to make sure that they're getting the authentic version. In turn, Gemini
                    can help Libra step away from overanalyzing and into action. Together, these two signs are unstoppable.

        <div class="facts">
            <div class="nocenter">
                <p><span class="gold">Best Gifts:</span> Ruled by the mind, Gemini love gifts that make them think. A luxe
                    journal can help them keep track of their daydreams, while a book—especially on a subject they've never
                    studied—is always a welcome gift. Gemini is also one of the Zodiac's more organized signs, and anything
                    to help the Twins keep their possessions in check (like an amazing organizer) or their dreams in sight
                    (like a cool fitness-tracking tech toy) will be welcome.</p>
    
                <p><span class="gold">Best Spa Package:</span> Multitaskers in life, Gemini love the same in a spa
                    treatment. Whether it's a scrub and massage package or a body-toning and facial combo, Gemini adore
                    different sensations—and also love the feeling that they're being pampered head to toe.</p>
    
                <p><span class="gold">Best Cocktail:</span> Dirty martini. Gemini adore the theater surrounding a cocktail,
                    and the frenetic rhythm of a cocktail shaker is the kind of multisensory experience that excite Gemini
                    when going out for drinks. But they're not exclusive: If they're at a sticky-floored dive bar, Gemini
                    are happy to order a beer. In general, Gemini choose the drink based on the location.</p>
    
                <h2>Social Life</h2>
                <p>Gemini starts pretty much every sentence with "my friends and I," and a quick scroll through their social
                    media feed will reveal just how many people Gemini have in their life. This sign tends to draw energy
                    from hanging out with others, and also loves connecting one-on-one in conversation. Active and driven,
                    Gemini are happy to flit from event to event, and are often up for challenge of a four-party evening.
                    But they're also ready for one-on-one get-togethers, where they enjoy debating, going into deep
                    conversations, and connecting beyond a superficial level. A Gemini is rarely lonely, and he or she is
                    good at reaching out for support or company.</p>
    
                <h2>Best Vacations</h2>
                <p>While they won't turn down a beach vacation, Gemini love trips where they can also learn and connect to
                    local culture. Gemini love foreign flings and are ecstatic when they learn how to successfully say a few
                    sentences in the language of whatever country they're visiting. When it comes to vacation, Gemini like
                    their to-do list, even if it's activities like "try as many different kinds of gelato as possible." To
                    Gemini, researching a destination is all part of the adventure, and planning a trip is (almost) as much
                    fun as going.</p>
    
                <h2>Favorite Season</h2>
                <p>This mutable sign is well matched with its late spring/early summer birthday. Like the season, Gemini can
                    display two very different sides, depending on the day. Daydreamer Gemini also loves the possibility
                    hanging in the early summer air, that magical time when travel plans are made, spontaneous outdoor
                    parties happen, and everyone seems to get a surge of that ready-for-summer energy. The Twins sign don't
                    like being cooped up. To them, the warm breezes of late spring are alive with freedom and possibility.

                <p><span class="gold">Ailments:</span> Sore throats</p>
                <p><span class="gold">Strengths:</span> Optimism</p>
                <p><span class="gold">Weaknesses:</span>
                    Gemini put their hands over their ears and pretends that things aren't happening. While dissociating can
                    be a helpful skill, being fully present in one's own body (and at the doctor's office) is an essential
                    skill for Gemini to maintain their best health.</p>
    
                <h2>Fitness Routines</h2>
                <p>Gemini love goals and to-do lists, but they also get bored from too much repetition. CrossFit, PiYo, or a
                    fitness streaming class are ideal, because the Twins get to try new things, can see themselves get
                    stronger, and aren't doing the same old workout. Gemini also love working out in groups. While their
                    primary competitor is Gemini, they love the socialization and motivation that comes from being part of a
                    team. They truly don't care if they win or lose, as long as they're having a good time, and they may be
                    just as happy to support a team from the sidelines, with a few leisurely laps around the field to count
                    as a workout.</p>
    
                <h2>About Coughs and Colds</h2>
                <p>Ruled by the lungs, Gemini can get dragged down by coughs, colds, and seasonal allergies. While Gemini
                    tend to power through the sniffles, they can more easily attract them when they're in a weakened state
                    and not living up to their Twin truth. Of course, it's essential to see a doctor, but Gemini find that
                    following their intuition can help them feel healthier, too. This sign is also ruled by the hands and
                    fingers, so Gemini may find themselves prone to arthritis, as well as feeling cold, sensitive, or
                    straight-up tingly. Gemini love to communicate, and because digital communication relies on the fingers,
                    there may be carpal tunnel issues. Gemini need to remain aware that taking care of the physical body is
                    key for them to shine.</p>
    
                <h2>Healing Herbs for Intensity</h2>
                <p><span class="gold">Oregan and Cumin:</span> These herbs can help activate Gemini's energies, allowing
                    them to get things done instead of spending time daydreaming in their own heads.</p>
                <p><span class="gold">Parsley:</span> It's not just for salads! Having this plant on hand is key for Gemini.
                    It can help soothe throat-related problems, which is an essential cure that belongs Gemini's herbal
                    medicine cabinet.</p>
                <p><span class="gold">Lavender:</span> Associated with the planet Mercury, lavender can help calm Gemini and
                    give them good dreams, clear their focus, and allow them to harness their energies.</p>
                <p><span class="gold">Anise:</span> A drop of anise-infused honey can help soothe Gemini ailments, and may
                    also help this sign tackle their extensive to-do lists.</p>

            <div class="nocenter">
                <h2>Work Style</h2>
                <p>Gemini love diving into a project and don't mind working late hours—if the project interests them. If it
                    doesn't, they can have a tough time finding the motivation to hit deadlines. Social Gemini see their
                    workplace as another venue for meeting new friends and connections, and they truly love coffee break
                    chatter that others may find tedious. Gemini adore collaboration and often become close friends with
                    their coworkers. But Gemini don't love rigid, rule-oriented jobs, and they abhor the feeling of a manger
                    breathing down their neck. They expect and enjoy autonomy in their assignments, as well as their
                    coworkers' trust that they'll get it done. Gemini also love working when the mood strikes them—they'll
                    happily wake up at midnight to finish an assignment if it means freeing up the afternoon to pursue
                    another passion. While the Twins excel at conceptualizing all kinds of projects, opportunities, and
                    plans, they might not be such rock stars at breaking their vision down into clear steps and a realistic
                    timeline. Working with a fiery Aries or a meticulous Taurus can help ensure that Gemini will get the job
                    done.</p>
    
                <h2>Money</h2>
                <p>Gemini aren't especially attached to material goods; they're much more attached to personal validation.
                    Because of this, Twins may jump on volunteer and low paying opportunities that carry some sort of
                    prestige. Gemini have a deep sense of their personal value and what they bring to the table, but it may
                    not make a difference to them if that value is matched monetarily. They also love showing off sometimes,
                    and are more likely to spend money while they have it rather than saving for a rainy day. So it's
                    essential for Gemini to learn prudence and make sure that they can rein in their spending impulse.</p>
