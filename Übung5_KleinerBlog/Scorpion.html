                    <h2>Scorpio Zodiac Sign Traits</h2>

                    <p>Passionate, independent, and unafraid to blaze their own trail no matter what others think,
                        Scorpio signs make a statement wherever they go. They love debates, aren't afraid of
                        controversy, and won't back down from a debate. They also hate people who aren't genuine, and
                        are all about being authentic—even if authentic isn't pretty.</p>

                    <p>Because of all of these traits, a Scorpio can seem intimidating and somewhat closed off to those
                        who don't know them well. But what people don't realize is that even though Scorpio may seem
                        brusque, as a water sign, they also are very in tune with their emotions, and sometimes may find
                        themselves caught up in their feelings.</p>

                    <p>This leads to Scorpio's central conflict: Their feelings are what drives them and strengthens
                        them, but their mutability can scare them and make them feel vulnerable and out of control.
                        Because of this conflict, Scorpios, like their namesake, the scorpion, put up an outer shell and
                        may seem prickly.</p>

                    <p>But once people get beyond the shell, they find a loyal, loving person whose passion knows no
                        bounds. Scorpio dives into all life has to offer with 110% enthusiasm. A Scorpio will be your
                        most loyal friend, most dedicated employee—and your worst enemy, if they want to be.</p>

                    <p>In love, Scorpio can seem cautious at first, and may set up a series of "tests" for their
                        potential partner, deciding to cross them off their list if they don't meet their demands. The
                        trouble is, they tend to keep their partner out of the loop on what, exactly, they want, making
                        their partner feel like they have to play mind reader. If a Scorpio and their partner can get
                        past this initial hurdle, the connection will be intense, in both highs and lows. A Scorpio will
                        love harder and fight harder than any other sign, and wants their partner to be absolutely
                        honest. They will be—even if it's not what the partner wants to hear. In the bedroom, Scorpio is
                        generous, imaginative, and always up for anything—all night long.</p>

                <h2>Friendship Compatibilty</h2>
                <p>A Scorpio friend will tell you like it is, whether you want to know or not. The good news: You never have to worry about where you stand with a Scorpio; they will let you know. But you will have to realize that a Scorpio won't BS you or lie to you—and they will absolutely let you know when you haven't lived up to your potential. A Scorpio can be a friend for life, and can make you laugh harder, think deeper, and have more fun than you ever thought possible. So don't be so sensitive and go along for the ride.</p>

            <div class="nocenter">
                <h2>Love Compatibilty</h2>
                <p>Ruled by fiery Mars and destructive Pluto, a Scorpio in love has one mode for relationships—and that's full-on. Scorpio loves romance and passion, including up-all-night fights. Scorpio never does anything halfway, and believes that true love comes with true fights.</p>

                <p>Flirtatious, seductive, and mysterious, Scorpio loves playing hard to get initially, and may look like they never take the lead. This isn't true, though. Scorpio can pull the strings, relying on body language and subconscious cues to make their potential partner do exactly what they want them to do. Scorpio loves the chase, and loves the drama and pageantry that comes with initial dates. They love going all out with outfits, reservations, and candles and truly want to be the best date you've ever had.</p>

                <p>While Scorpio may seem like they're well-versed in love, and they love seduction, they can be cautious when it comes to settling into an LTR. That's because water sign Scorpio hides a lot of emotion underneath their surface, and when they open up to a significant other, they want it to be for life. When a Scorpio does let their guard down, it's a big deal, and a sign they truly want the relationship to last.</p>
               
                <h2>Love Matches</h2>
                <p><span class="gold">Cancer:</span> Passionate and in tune with their emotions, Cancer and Scorpio can have an almost psychic connection, and Cancer's innate understanding of Scorpio can help avoid any hurt feelings. For them, there are no words needed to describe their feelings for each other—which may be a good thing since verbal communication is not always the most comfortable for two water signs. These are two people who fundamentally, intrinsically, and instinctively just "get" each other.
                </p>

                <p><span class="gold">Aquarius:</span> These are both signs who are used to marching to the beat of their own drummer. Cool Sagittarius can provide the pragmatism that Scorpio needs to diffuse some of their intense emotions. They make an odd match, with airy Aquarius valuing logic and sociability and Scorpio preferring quiet nights at home or with a small group of close friends. Often, Aquarius will feel limited by Scorpio, while Scorpio feels pushed in directions they aren't comfortable going.</p>

                <p><span class="gold">Taurus:</span> Between Taurus and Scorpio, it's true that opposites attract. Grounded earth sign Taurus may initially seem too staid for intense Scorpio, but this match can last precisely because Taurus won't get drawn into any drama. Due to both valuing their privacy, many of their friends and family might not learn about the relationship for years—if at all. They love in secret, but they love deeply. As fixed signs, they are dependable and stable. But watch out: jealousy, obsession, and stubbornness could blow out this flame.</p>

        <div class="facts">
            <div class="nocenter">
                <p><span class="gold">Best Gifts:</span> A beautiful scarf, a candle, or some essential oils. Scorpios love accessories that elevate all of their senses.</p>

                <p><span class="gold">Best Spa Package:</span> Reiki. Sure, it's not exactly a spa treatment, but Scorpio, with their genuine interest in the metaphysical love that a treatment doesn't require touch to be effective, and love the way reiki allows them to tune into themselves while getting attuned.</p>

                <p><span class="gold">Best Cocktail:</span> Malbec, or any other rich, deep, red wine. Scorpio can't resist a deep red wine, preferably sipped with a lover.</p>

                <h2>Social Life</h2>
                <p>Scorpio has the pick of who to hang out with, and everyone is entranced, captivated, and—ok, a little afraid—of them. Scorpio tends to do their own thing, and isn't pulled by peer pressure. Scorpio adores fine wine, fancy restaurants, and A-list access, and loves getting a behind-the-scenes look into a party. Because of this, they tend to make friends with artists, chefs, and other people who set the pulse of a city. In addition, they are often the pulse of a city, and find that a job that can combine their social life and real life is often ideal.</p>               

                <h2>Best Vacations</h2>
                <p>Scorpio love going places where no one else has gone before, and is all about exclusive, intimate tours of foreign cities. They love meeting locals, and have a special charm and knack for getting introduced to VIPs in whatever city they're in—even if they're only visiting for 24 hours. Scorpio bypasses the so-called tourist attractions in favor of small boutiques, insider-only restaurants, and other experiences they deem authentic.</p>

                <h2>Favorite Season</h2>
                <p>Their birthdays are in late fall, and Scorpio loves cold snaps, dusky weather, and long, dark nights just made for cuddling up on sensuous sheets. Scorpio adores evening, and adores long nights that last well into the wee hours. Scorpio also isn't afraid of a cold snap—they're happy to be out in all elements, and love the wild and sexy unpredictability of a raging winter storm.</p>

            <div class="nocenter">
                <p><span class="gold">Ailments:</span> UTI's and other below-the-belt issues</p>
                <p><span class="gold">Strengths:</span> Passion</p>
                <p><span class="gold">Weaknesses:</span>
                    Intense workout classes. Scorpio can be almost masochistic when it comes to exercise, and loves working out harder, longer, and faster than anyone else.</p>

                <h2>Fitness Routines</h2>
                <p>Boxing. Whether it's getting in the ring or just taking classes, you thrive on breaking a sweat and, bonus, can simultaneously get rid of frustrations that are plaguing you.</p>

                <h2>About Below The Belt Issues</h2>
                <p>For Scorpio, their sex organs are one of their biggest joys and biggest headaches. Scorpio sees sex as a union of the mind and body, and when they're not feeling fully in tune with themselves or a relationship, they're likely to feel less than great below the belt. The upside is that Scorpio has learned that absolute honesty—in and out of the bedroom—can help feel them as healthy as they can be. Scorpio won't lie or cheat—the sex won't be enjoyable, and it's just not worth it. The more honest they are with themselves, the more happy their parts will be!</p>               

                <h2>Healing Herbs for Intensity</h2>
                <p><span class="gold">Aloe Vera:</span> Can soothe Scorpio's intensity and remind them to cool down!
                </p>
                <p><span class="gold">Raspberry Leaf:</span> Connects to the reproductive organs to help them calm down (especially if a female Scorpio is suffering from cramps) and can help soothe any nerves.</p>
                <p><span class="gold">Ginger:</span> Spicy and intense, adding ginger to a recipe or using as a supplement can help calm Scorpio's anxiety.</p>
                <p><span class="gold">Coriander:</span> Used often in love spells, this herb can help Scorpio tune into their passion and make sure their passion is being directed toward good.</p>

            <div class="nocenter">
                <h2>Work Style</h2>
                <p>Scorpio is all about burning the candle at both ends—when they're passionate about a project. It can take a few false starts for Scorpio to find their footing, and when Scorpio doesn't like the team they're on at work, watch out. Scorpio would much rather do the work solo than attempt to work with people they feel don't bring anything to the table.</p>

                <p>Scorpio are fiercely intelligent and amazing multi taskers, so they thrive at being entrepreneurs. Scorpio is committed, and can see a project through to a final vision. Scorpio needs independence and trust to pull off a project, and hates having someone else look over their shoulder.</p>

                <p>Scorpio can be a demanding boss, but can also be one that employees love. They are fair, exacting, and want their employees to be the best they can be. They're great at spotting and nurturing talent, and inspire people to work their hardest.</p>

                <h2>Money</h2>
                <p>Scorpio has a complicated relationship with money. Their intelligence and street smarts means they make money easily, but their love of luxury means that it's also easily spent. Scorpio can get frustrated because they know what they "should" be doing with their cash, but sometimes have a hard time having enough discipline to follow through. Scorpio can get jealous when others have more than they have, especially if they perceive the person who has it isn't as intelligent or hardworking as them. The more Scorpio takes charge of their money, including proactively investing, the better they'll feel.
