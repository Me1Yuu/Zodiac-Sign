                    <h2>Cancer Zodiac Sign Traits</h2>

                    <p>Emotional, intuitive, and practically psychic; ruled by the moon and characterized by the crab, Cancer has so much going on in its watery depths. Cancer signs may seem prickly and standoffish at first meeting, once they make the decision to become friends with someone, that person has a friend for life.</p>

                    <p>Most Cancer signs have been called psychic at some point, and with good reason—Cancer can often intuit relationships, ideas, and motivations before anyone has actually spoken. That can make for challenging interactions with this sign—Cancer hates small talk, especially when it contains white lies (like saying, "How nice to see you!" when it's clear that both parties would rather avoid each other). That's why social gatherings can be overwhelming for Cancers. They'd much rather spend time in small groups where everyone is on the same page.</p>

                    <p>In romance, Cancer is a giving and generous lover and expects the same in return. The Crab is above mind games and hates the thrill of the chase—if you love someone, why not say it now? It's not uncommon for Cancer to fall into committed love after just a few days or weeks, and even though that decision is sudden, it can easily last a lifetime. Cancers tends to be happiest when they're part of a pair, and the best relationship brings out their greatest traits. But even though a Cancer thrives in a duo, he or she also has an independent streak, and needs plenty of time to do things solo. This sign has an active internal life, and is often are happy living in the realm of imagination. Sometimes Cancers need help from one of the more grounded signs to make their dreams a reality.</p>

                    <p>Cancer loves creating and needs some type of creative outlet, whether it's painting, writing, or even just reading. Cancer also loves connecting to a higher power, and may find comfort in religion or spiritual practices. And even though Crabs can be intense, they also have a funny side with a wry sense of humor, and they're adept at observing and mimicking people around them.</p>

                    <p>Finally, Cancer is incredibly loyal, sometimes to a fault. Cancers will go to the ends of the earth and even against their own beliefs to help someone they love. Learning how to step up for what they believe in—even if it means turning down or against a friend—is a lifelong lesson for Cancer. As the emotional heart of the Zodiac, this sign teaches everyone else that, while there's so much in life that we may not be able to see, we should still pay attention to the unseen because it does exist—and we do need it!</p>

                <h2>Friendship Compatibilty</h2>
                <p>Cancers may turn down the first invite you give them. They may even turn down the fifth. But once they finally say yes, know that you may have found a real friend. While Cancers, like their spirit animal the Crab, are known for their thick outer shell, trust that the standoffishness is all an act. Get a bit below the surface, and you'll find that a Cancer is all feelings. Because of that, they tend to protect themselves in public, and until you really get to know them, they're likely to answer any friendly "How are you?" question with a curt "Fine."</p>

                <p>The good news is once Cancer has your back, you have a friend for life. One of the most nonjudgmental signs of the Zodiac, Cancer will always listen and sympathize with you—even if you did make a pretty big mistake. Cancers aren't interested in petty drama, either, and they won't share your business with other people unless you give them explicit instruction that it's okay.</p>

                <p>Cancers love deep conversations, but they also have pretty firm boundaries around "their" time. Don't be offended if they turn down an invite—chances are, they truly need the downtime. And Crabs can be possessive—especially of the friends they love. If they don't like your other friends, they may turn prickly. But hear them out. Cancers have an excellent sense of people's true colors, and there may be a good reason they want you to stay away from someone.</p>

            <div class="nocenter">
                <h2>Love Compatibilty</h2>
                <p>Sensual, passionate, and super in tune with their bodies, Cancers are highly attuned to love and physical sensation—as long as they can trust enough to let down their barriers and allow another person into their world. Cancer can be cagey about the dating game, and engaging in the getting-to-know-you game, either on text or through conversation, can feel like torture for sensitive Crabs. Cancer much prefers discovering and checking out potential partners in low-stress settings, such as in a class, as neighbors, or at a local coffee shop.</p>

                <p>Cancers sometimes get frustrated that their partner doesn't know everything that's going on in their internal life, and they can easily put up walls and say it's all good when everything is clearly the exact opposite. In order to truly connect, Cancers must be patient with their partner and voice their emotional needs—and these lessons can have a steep learning curve for this sign. Crabs want a partner who can bear witness to their emotional ups and downs, yet they can lash out if their partner tries to "fix" things. Sometimes, all Cancer needs to do is vent.</p>

                <p>In bed, Cancer is happiest with long, passionate lovemaking. While props, toys, and shower sex can all be fun, Cancer's absolute favorite is any position that allows plenty of eye contact with his or her lover. Crabs want to cuddle after sex (if they feel trusted and in love), and they're always up for a lazy day spent entirely under the covers.</p>

                <p>This sign plays for keeps, and believes in in his or her partner. Sometimes, Crabs may struggle with letting a relationship end, and their breakups may have to happen several times before they accept that it's really over. On the flip side, Cancer takes loyalty very seriously, and a breach of loyalty, however small it seems, can be a deal-breaker for a Cancer.</p>

                <p>Bottom line: Cancer loves to be loved, and loves love itself—but communication and conversation are what really allow this sign's bonds to flourish.</p>

                <h2>Love Matches</h2>
                <p><span class="gold">Taurus:</span> Steadfast and passionate, Taurus is a fixed sign that can help ground cardinal Cancer. Both Taurus and Cancer are very connected to their physical bodies, and share an intense, almost psychic, sensuality. For Taurus and Cancer, even brushing each other's hand can create an electric current. Taurus can help inspire Cancer to action, while Cancer can help Taurus tune into deeper emotions.</p>

                <p><span class="gold">Pisces:</span> Cardinal Cancer and mutable Pisces both have intense emotional reservoirs, so they both understand that sometimes people need to cry just because, and that an epic fight doesn't necessarily mean a relationship is over. Imaginative and intuitive, Pisces and Cancer are happy in their collective heads, and they delight in dreaming up many future life scenarios. Taking action is an altogether different matter, but luckily for this couple, Cancer is good at rallying people to make dreams a reality.</p>

                <p><span class="gold">Scorpio:</span> When these two water signs meet, the magnetism between them packs the cosmic wallop of a strong electric charge. What holds this couple together is their fierce loyalty and their understanding that emotional eruptions aren't necessarily a sign of being a bad match, but more likely a sign of their intense connection.</p>

        <div class="facts">
            <div class="nocenter">
                <p><span class="gold">Best Gifts:</span> Ruled by the heart, nostalgic Cancer loves connecting to the past. Photo albums, heirlooms, and personalized handmade gifts are the best way to a Cancer's heart. As a domestic creature, the Crab also adores gifts for the home. Home is their haven, so wine, kitchen gadgets, or luxe shower scrubs are ideal.</p>

                <p><span class="gold">Best Spa Package:</span> Sensuous Cancer craves head-to-toe pampering and loves different sensations. First a salt scrub and then a shower followed by a long massage is ideal for Cancers, as it gives them plenty of time to sink into their physical self, forget about their mind, and fully succumb to bodily pleasure.</p>

                <p><span class="gold">Best Cocktail:</span> Pinot Grigio. Cancer delights in a glass of wine, preferably in a low-lit wine bar or while watching the sunset. Crabs will happily skip the bar scene, and a glass of wine at home by candle light is the ideal way to unwind with their loved one after a long day.</p>

                <h2>Social Life</h2>
                <p>It's typical for Cancer to have friendships that span decades, and this sign loves nothing more than playing the "remember when" game with old friends. Cancer also cherishes family connections, and it's not unusual for Crabs to count their siblings, or even their parents, as members of their social circle. Cancers are usually partnered, and their partner tends to show up for all social events. And while Cancers will RSVP 'yes' if a party is important for the host, they're likely to bow out after doing the initial rounds—socializing in large groups just isn't Cancer's favorite thing.

                </p>

                <h2>Best Vacations</h2>
                <p>Water sign Cancer won't say no to the beach, but they also love exploring different parts of the world, especially if the trip consists of a hike, a swim in a lake, or some other way of communing with nature. And while Cancers don't mind getting their hair dirty on a roughing-it vacation, they also love luxury. Staying at a five-star beach resort—especially with their lover—is a great way for Cancer to de-stress, lose inhibitions, and succumb purely to pleasure.</p>

                <h2>Favorite Season</h2>
                <p>While this cardinal sign may have a birthday at the height of summer, Cancers are drawn the cozied-up feeling of winter. They love sitting by a warm fire, cuddling under the covers, and stepping out into freshly fallen snow. But even though Crabs may love the trappings of winter, they also need a daily dose of sun and may become depressed if they have to spend all day under artificial lights between commuting to and from work in the dark. Making sure to get a dose of sun (or a UV light) can be incredibly beneficial for this sign.</p>

        <label for="health">Health</label>
        <div class="facts">
            <div class="nocenter">
                <p><span class="gold">Ailments:</span> Stomach and digestive system ailments</p>
                <p><span class="gold">Strengths:</span> Fortitude</p>
                <p><span class="gold">Weaknesses:</span>
                    When things don't feel right in Cancers' life, they can feel it in their gut—literally. When Crabs feel that they can't express their emotions, or that it's not safe to do so, they develop stomach pains, digestive ailments, and other GI troubles.</p>

                <h2>Fitness Routines</h2>
                <p>More than any other sign, Cancer intuitively feels the mind-body connection and sees fitness as essential to calming the mind and finding space in the day for tuning into his or her body. Cancer sees fitness as an almost spiritual practice—a time to commune uninterrupted with mind and body—and tends to shy away from group fitness classes where an instructor can interfere with the flow. Cancer has a reserve of self-discipline, doesn't have any problem DIY-ing a routine, and may find yoga, running, or Pilates to be great ways to simultaneously move and meditate.</p>

                <h2>About Stomach Aches</h2>
                <p>Ruled primarily by the chest and stomach, this sensitive water sign feels everything physically. Whether it's a tightening of the chest when something feels emotionally off or stomach butterflies, Cancers feel physically sick when they're not emotionally in tune with their life. Ignoring the problem won't make it go away, and rich foods can make the issue worse. For Cancer, tummy-calming foods like oatmeal, steamed veggies, and rice can help make them feel better, but in general, a rollercoaster tummy or major abdominal cramps is a sign that something external needs to be fixed, ASAP.</p>

                <h2>Healing Herbs for Intensity</h2>
                <p><span class="gold">Eucalyptus:</span> This fresh, all-purpose healing plant can help Cancer heal psychic and physical scars.</p>
                <p><span class="gold">Fenugreek:</span> This maple syrup-scented herb can help cure Cancer's notoriously sensitive tummy.</p>
                <p><span class="gold">Parsley:</span> This herb, an excellent digestive aid can help Cancer figure out what's really causing their gastrointestinal distress.</p>
                <p><span class="gold">Jasmine:</span> The heavenly-scented flower can help with this sign's subconscious thoughts, allowing them to let go of the past, focus on the future, and tap into their optimism.</p>

        <div class="facts">
            <div class="nocenter">
                <h2>Work Style</h2>
                <p>Did someone say "burning the midnight oil?" Independent Cancer doesn't necessarily love the structure of office life, and this sign may produce their best work on their own time—especially in the wee hours. Crabs love working hard and knowing that a job is well done, but they may bristle at becoming part of a team with all its time-consuming interpersonal issues. Cancers hate the feeling of a manager breathing down their neck, and in order to succeed, they need to feel like their schedule and work product are their own.</p>

                <p>While definitely good management material, Cancer can also become exasperated by colleagues who don't share his or her vision—and may also hold career-long grudges. This sign isn't especially driven by fortune and fame, but they do want a great life, and they may compromise a career track in favor of a satisfying work-life balance.</p>

                <p>Blessed with a strong sense of self, this water sign cannot stand interoffice jockeying, and often feels that work drama distracts from work. This is despite the fact sometimes Cancer unwittingly takes part in work drama—when Crabs experience hurt feelings or think they've been overlooked, their inability to let go manifests in an attitude than can earn them the label "difficult." The only way to fix this is confronting the issue head on.</p>

                <h2>Money</h2>
                <p>Cancer places a great deal of importance on comfort, especially in the home. To that end, this sign feels it's imperative to have a job that covers the bills, with enough of a financial cushion in case the worst happens. Crabs love well-made products, which are usually more expensive. They see consumerism as a way to enact change in their world, so they often buy with their heart. But Cancer doesn't care about becoming the richest or wealthiest. Once their needs are provided for, they're happy to dial back work if it means spending more time with the people they love.</p>
