                    <h2>Aries Zodiac Sign Traits</h2>

                    <p>The first sign of the Zodiac, Aries are the trailblazers. Passionate and independent, Aries will
                        never do something just because everyone else is doing it—a Ram needs to be 100 percent
                        committed to the task at hand. Competitive to the max, the best way to motivate an Aries is to
                        turn something into a contest. Aries will put everything they have (and then some) into winning.
                        Loyal, smart, and impulsive, they always have multiple projects on their mind, and won't be
                        satisfied until their work, social life, and personal lives line up exactly with the dream life
                        they've envisioned. Those who are drawn to magnetic Aries may have trouble keeping up—but if
                        they can, they'll have a friend for life.</p>

                    <p>An Aries sign will always tell you what they're thinking, with a frankness that may occasionally
                        border on rudeness. But even if an Aries seems overly blunt with their opinion, that's only
                        because Rams value honesty above all else. And it works both ways. While an Aries may be the
                        first to say if they think that you just phoned in a project, they'll also be the first to
                        compliment you for a job well done. Rams may also have a short fuse. That fiery temper can be an
                        asset. When an Aries is angry, they'll never play the passive-aggressive card. But for people
                        who don't know them well, their temper can be a turn off. Learning how to work out their
                        anger—whether by going to the gym every day, taking some deep breaths, or learning to chill
                        before they Tweet their thoughts to the world—is a lifelong process for Rams.</p>

                <h2>Friendship Compatibilty</h2>
                <p>"Activity" is the key word for this sign. When it comes to Aries' friends, the more variety, the
                    better. Easy to meet and get along with, an Aries makes an incredible amount of connections in a
                    lifetime. Long-term friends are trickier. Only those who are equally energetic and able to keep up
                    are apt to stay connected with an Aries for the long haul. Aries are inspired by action and get
                    bored by too many coffee dates. Think: long hikes, pottery classes, or hitting up an old-school
                    arcade—anything new, offbeat, quirky, or action-packed.</p>

        <div class="facts">
            <div class="nocenter">
                <h2>Love Compatibilty</h2>
                <p>Like their ruling planet Mars, Aries are hot and stormy. They're a combination of confidence and
                    passion combined with temper and petulance. Everyone who ever loves an Aries tries—unsuccessfully
                    but excitingly—to tame them.</p>

                <p>This wildly flirtatious fire sign certainly takes the initiative when it comes to romance. They're
                    quick to move when someone catches their eye. But to keep an Aries' attention, that someone needs to
                    be as energetic and as exciting as they are. This passionate sign loves adventure. So don't mistake
                    an Aries' restlessness for boredom. It's not a signal that they'd prefer to be somewhere else (or
                    with someone else). It's a signal they want to pick up the pace!</p>

                <p>Whirlwind romances are common for the Aries personality. But once love sets in, it's generally for
                    life. As long as there's plenty of spice and excitement to keep the blood pumping, the relationship
                    will be strong and long lasting.</p>

                <h2>Love Matches</h2>
                <p><span class="gold">Gemini:</span> Smart, mysterious, and up for anything, Gemini's deep personality
                    keeps Aries endlessly intrigued, while Gemini loves Aries' no-holds-barred approach to life.</p>

                <p><span class="gold">Libra:</span> Balanced and low-key, Libra can rein Aries in, encouraging them to
                    reflect on their deeper self, which can sometimes be hard to do on their own.</p>

                <p><span class="gold">Sagittarius:</span> All about action and honesty, Archers are a true passion match
                    for Aries. Fights will likely be stormy, but since both signs are honest, they'll at least know
                    where the other stands.</p>

                <p><span class="gold">Taurus:</span> Aries often sees Taurus as tame and can get exasperated by the
                    Bull's rational, consider-all-points approach to life. But if Aries can get past that, they may just
                    find a match that will show them how good (and steamy!) slow and steady can be.</p>

        <label for="lifestyle">Lifestyle</label>
        <div class="facts">
            <div class="nocenter">
                <p><span class="gold">Best Gifts:</span> Yoga mats, cool sneakers, an amazing sweatshirt that combines
                    style and leisure. Aries do love getting physical.</p>

                <p><span class="gold">Best Spa Package:</span> Cupping or acupuncture. All about intensity, Aries love
                    cutting edge treatments.</p>

                <p><span class="gold">Best Cocktail:</span> A prickly pear margarita or any brightly colored cocktail
                    that doubles as an accessory. For Aries, it's all about the presentation.</p>

                <h2>Social Life</h2>
                <p>Sometimes a Ram is all about socializing and thinks nothing of sparking conversations with strangers
                    or booking a solo trip to meet people along the way. Other times, the Ram can be reclusive, getting
                    lost in a book or the wilderness, or taking up a hobby that they'll challenge themselves to master
                    in a weekend.</p>

                <h2>Best Vacations</h2>
                <p>Adventure travel is a Ram's thing. Whether it's an organized surf camp or a solo backpacking
                    adventure, Aries loves the adrenaline rush that comes with travel. In fact, a Ram prefers to go
                    without reservations, simply because they love feeling the accomplishment of finding a hotel on the
                    fly. Thriving on challenges, an Aries loves a vacation that helps them accomplish a goal, hone a
                    skill, or practice self-improvement. While they're happy sitting on the beach for a bit, you're much
                    more likely to catch them dashing in and out of the waves for hours on end.</p>

                <h2>Favorite Season</h2>
                <p>Even though Aries are born in early spring, they're all about the anything-can-happen vibe of summer.
                    An action-packed Fourth of July weekend is pretty much heaven for an Aries. It's all about making
                    the most of every single second, which is why they thrive on the long days of summer, when they can
                    run from the gym to their job to an al fresco dinner, all before nightfall.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <input type="radio" id="health" name="tabs">

        <div class="facts">
            <div class="nocenter">
                <p><span class="gold">Ailments:</span> Headaches</p>
                <p><span class="gold">Strengths:</span> Energy</p>
                <p><span class="gold">Weaknesses:</span>
                    Green juice, trendy diets, and too-good-to-be-true miracle cures. Even though Rams know that there's
                    no quick fix, they can't resist any product that claims to give them an edge over other people.</p>

                <h2>Fitness Routines</h2>
                <p>Aries are all about living it up every single moment and rarely have a shortage of energy. Aries can
                    frequently be found at the gym, which they truly think of as a happy space. Generally healthy, Aries
                    know how to indulge when the time is right but can feel lethargic and blah if they abstain from
                    physical activity for too long.</p>

                <h2>About Headaches</h2>
                <p>Ruled by the head, Rams experience frequent headaches, so it's important for them to learn how to add
                    R&R to their wellness routine. Rams aren't good at resting, but downtime can curb a headache before
                    it starts. They should also make sure to drink water—because in their quest to be the best, Rams may
                    skip this step at the gym. Finally, Rams honestly must get regular medical check-ups. Feeling unwell
                    isn't a failure, and booking an appointment can keep a Ram in top-notch shape for their go-go-go
                    lifestyle!</p>

                <h2>Healing Herbs for Intensity</h2>
                <p><span class="gold">Rosemary:</span> Stimulates the body and mind and improves memory; key for an
                    Aries with a million things on their mind.</p>
                <p><span class="gold">Cayenne:</span> Helps cleanse the digestive system and improve circulation; key
                    for Aries' intense lifestyle.</p>
                <p><span class="gold">Garlic:</span> Either cooked or in tea, garlic fights infections and reduces
                    cholesterol and blood pressure in a stressed-out Aries.</p>
                <p><span class="gold">Powdered Mustard:</span> An ancient symbol of faith, mustard can help keep Aries
                    grounded.</p>

        <input type="radio" id="business" name="tabs">
        <label for="business">Career and Money</label>
        <div class="facts">
            <div class="nocenter">
                <h2>Work Style</h2>
                <p>Career is the area of life where Aries is apt to shine the brightest. Ambitious, creative, and often
                    driven by the need to be the best they can be, the Ram is at their best in the workplace. Born
                    leaders, Aries are far more comfortable taking charge than taking orders. They thrive as a manager
                    and will often find their colleagues coming to them for advice.</p>

                <p>Some signs struggle with change, but Aries initiates it. Getting a project underway is what gets them
                    up in the morning, but tying up loose ends, checking off punch lists, or maintaining the status quo?
                    No, thanks.</p>

                <p>Aries' striving, competitive nature can lead to friction at work, so it's important for the Ram to
                    remember they they're part of a team. In fact, the sign benefits greatly from working with others.
                    And while it's true that they don't need the help of others to kick-start a project, Aries' greatest
                    power comes from their chemistry with co-workers, who in return benefit from their infectious
                    energy.</p>

                <h2>Money</h2>
                <p>Even though an Aries is wise to save for a rainy day, this isn't likely the case. Because Rams prize
                    excitement, shopping, gambling, and playing the market are far more appealing to them. They aren't
                    too focused on their financial future. In fact, living for the moment is the true Aries philosophy.
                    Money is rarely scarce because they love working, but it can be spent almost as quickly as it comes
                    in. The one thing you can be absolutely sure of is that Aries will have as much fun making as much
                    money as they possibly can!</p>
