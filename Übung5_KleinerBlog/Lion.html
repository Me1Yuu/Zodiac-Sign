                    <h2>Leo Zodiac Sign Traits</h2>

                    <p>Bold, intelligent, warm, and courageous, fire sign Leo is a natural leader of the Zodiac, ready to blaze a trail, vanquish injustice, and make a name for themselves along the way. Blessed with high self-esteem, Lions know that they possess enviable traits—and they're proud of them. They don't believe in false modesty and will be the first to praise themselves for a job well done. But Leo isn't self-aggrandizing or unwilling to roll up those sleeves and do the work: this sign knows that in order to be respected and admired, he or she needs to put in the effort worthy of a leader.</p>

                    <p>But it's not all hard work for Lions. Intense and energetic, Leos thrive on social interactions and have no problem making friends—although pinning them down to spend time with you is another story. Leos put themselves first, and will turn down a plan that doesn't fit with their agenda or idea of fun. This trait has gained them an unfair reputation for arrogance. But on the flip side, when a Lion chooses to spend time with you, it's genuinely because he or she wants to.</p>

                    <p>Leo signs are passionate in all pursuits, including relationships, and take it upon themselves to be the best partner you've ever had. They love grand gestures, and they want to show the world how attentive and caring they can be. They also can't resist flashiness and often buy their partner the biggest and best presents. Leo is an adventurer, seeking to balance an intense life of social obligations and travel with plenty of downtime to relax and luxuriate. Work and outward appearances matter to this sign, and they're willing to do whatever it takes to gain a job title or workplace status, even if it means temporarily sacrificing their precious leisure time.</p>

                    <p>Benevolent with their time and attention, Leos are never cliquey, always showing friendliness and politeness to everyone. While almost everyone else is entranced by the Leonine personality, Leos are their own harshest critic and consider each day a challenge to be the best, brightest, and boldest Lion they can be.</p>

                <h2>Friendship Compatibilty</h2>
                <p>"Friends" is one of Leo's favorite words, and Lions are known for collecting friends—but not in a transactional way. Leo genuinely adores other people, and innately gets that the more people you know, the easier life can be. Leos easily hand out their phone number, are quick to follow or DM on Instagram, and will invite you to their happy hour five minutes after meeting you. But getting to know a Leo on a deeper level can be challenging. For starters, it's tough to pin down someone with that kind of social schedule. And although Lions are friendly, they won't share their inner emotional life until they're really close with you. A Leo is a valuable ally in your social circle, and when he or she does reveal secrets, listen up and feel honored!</p>

        <div class="facts">
            <div class="nocenter">
                <h2>Love Compatibilty</h2>
                <p>Passionate, intense, and fiery, Leo loves hard. For Leos, love itself—whether falling in love, thinking about love, making love—is one of their favorite things in the world. A busy Lion will always make sure that there's plenty of time for passion in his or her life.</p>

                <p>Falling in love is easy for Lions. But finding a person who can match them and staying in love can be tough. Leo loves flirting and dating, and has no problem penciling new names onto the calendar. This sign loves the rollercoaster that is romance, from butterflies before the first date to catching their breath after the first time in bed. But while Lions thrive on the novelty of dating, they can be easily disappointed if their date fails to live up to their outsize expectations. That's why Leos occasionally finds true love with partners they may have dated or broken up with in the past.</p>

                <p>In the bedroom, Leo is playful, and frequently imagines that he or she is performing. Your Leo lover may want to capture your shared carnal experience on video or, at the very least, have a few strategically placed mirrors in the room. Leo loves dirty talk (especially praise for a job well done). Giving and generous when it comes to sex, Leo can spend hours pleasuring a partner—as long as the partner returns the favor.</p>

                <h2>Love Matches</h2>
                <p><span class="gold">Libra:</span> This air sign can temper Leo's fiery nature, and the two love socializing, enjoying the finer things in life, and making every day truly pleasurable.</p>

                <p><span class="gold">Scorpio:</span> Leo and Scorpio match each other in their intensity, and social Leo can prevent deep Scorpio from brooding too much. This fire and water sign are an instant power couple who can make amazing things happen if they work together.</p>

                <p><span class="gold">Aries:</span> Leo and Aries are energetic, passionate, and believe that too much of anything—be it wine, food, or sex—is never enough. This shared appetite can be awesome but also exhausting, since this pair will stay up all night in pursuit of their pleasures.</p>

                <p><span class="gold">Pisces:</span> Leo often sees Pisces as tame and can get exasperated by the Fish's fluid, imagine-all-points approach to life. But if Lions can get past that, they may just find a match that will show them how good (and steamy!) slow and steady can be.</p>

                <p><span class="gold">Best Gifts:</span> Designer shades, bling-y accessories, or exclusive gear that you have to special order. For Leo, it's all about labels, and the more recognizable (and Instagrammable), the better.</p>

                <p><span class="gold">Best Spa Package:</span> Lions purr for gel manicures and pedicures, which they consider just routine maintenance. For cutting-edge treatment, gift Leos with a crystal therapy light session; they love being in the know and checking out the newest or coolest treatments.</p>

                <h2>Social Life</h2>
                <p>A Lion loves being surrounded by friends, adulators, or even strangers who are about to become friends. Leos never shy away from RSVP'ing to a party without a plus one. They intrinsically know how to make friends and connect with people, and going to parties alone is a fun challenge to keep their friend-making skills razor sharp.

                </p>

                <h2>Best Vacations</h2>
                <p>Bring it on! This sign loves vacations where they can indulge on all levels, from food to hotels to shopping. Leos are equally enamored by trekking through a foreign city and relaxing on a favorite beach. Wherever they go, they never turn off those Leonine qualities: making friends, having fun, and commanding the spotlight. Even on a romantic getaway for two, there should be plenty of people nearby for conversations—for Leo, part of the fun of getting away is connecting with new friends.</p>

                <h2>Favorite Season</h2>
                <p>Born in the middle of summer, Leos adore the long hours of daylight, and they revel in making sure that every single moment counts. This summertime animal loves waking up early to catch the first glimpse of daylight, and often stays outside until the sun goes down. Ruled by the sun, Leo depends on warm weather getaways during colder months. For heat-loving Lions, it's not an indulgence—it's a necessity.</p>

                <p><span class="gold">Ailments:</span> Fevers</p>

                <p><span class="gold">Weaknesses:</span>
                    Supplements. Leo always wants to be the best, and can't say no to a pill, diet, or drink that promises to maximize this sign's potential.</p>

                <h2>Fitness Routines</h2>
                <p>Leo loves the see-and-be-seen atmosphere of a trendy cycling class or barre class, and also finds new workout clothes to be the best kind of reward for keeping and staying motivated. Leo thrives on competition and gets lonely working out all alone. Having a running buddy, belonging to a Facebook fitness group, or working with a personal trainer will help Lions keep their fitness goals on point.</p>

                <h2>About Temperature</h2>
                <p>The heart rules this fire sign, and because of that, their mental and physical experience is innately connected. Emotional issues will manifest by a temperature spike and a day spent in bed, and Leos are known for high fevers—often with few other symptoms. Talking through emotional problems, instead of just trying to forge through them, can help tame the Lion's temperature and help him or her feel better.</p>

                <h2>Healing Herbs for Intensity</h2>
                <p><span class="gold">Chamomile:</span> This soothing herb, whether in a teacup, a bar of soap, or just sniffed, helps Leo calm down and focus on self-care. Chamomile is key for breaking those frequent fevers as well.</p>
                <p><span class="gold">Lemon Balm:</span> Whether it's in a soap, shampoo, lip balm, or just smelled, the cheery scent of lemon help Leos focus on their internal optimism and move forward, even during a crisis or a bad day. This herb helps cleanse the digestive system and improve circulation, which is key for this sign's intense lifestyle.</p>
                <p><span class="gold">Tarragon:</span> This herb helps Leos focus on the connections that bind them to others, reminding them that no one, not even a Lion, is an island unto themselves.</p>
                <p><span class="gold">Aloe Vera:</span> This cool, healing plant can help temper a Leo's fiery personality.</p>

                <h2>Work Style</h2>
                <p>When a Leo loves work, there's no stopping him or her. Passionate and idealistic, Leos aren't driven by a paycheck (although they do love the luxuries money can buy). But a Leo who's only going through the motions at work is not a happy Lion. This sign can and will throw themselves into a job, and it's not uncommon for a Leo to work around the clock.</p>

                <p>A perfectionist, Leo bristles at team members who seem to coast. This natural leader inspires others, but may not always be the easiest co-worker. That's because Leos are so dedicated to their own vision that it may be hard for them to appreciate input and ideas from others. However, Leo is amazing at motivating others and at big-picture thinking, relying on other signs to do more detail-oriented steps.</p>

                <p>Leos may change jobs several times in their careers. They love the learning curve of a new job, meeting and excelling at its challenges, and then moving on to an industry where they feel their talents will be of more use. As a visionary, Leo is good at making strategic leaps and is a natural entrepreneur.</p>

                <h2>Money</h2>
                <p>Leos work hard for the money, and they want you to know it. Leo loves luxury, whether it's five-star hotels or designer labels, and isn't shy about splashing out cash for quality. But Leo isn't foolish. Although this sign appreciates spending money, they know how to think long-term, and there's a strategy behind their spending decisions. Leo's motto is "You can't take it with you," and Lions will crunch the numbers to live in the best style they can afford—without going into debt.</p>
