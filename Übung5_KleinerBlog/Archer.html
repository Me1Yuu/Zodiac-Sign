                    <h2>Sagittarius Zodiac Sign Traits</h2>

                    <p>Independent and strong-willed, Sagittarius personalities are all about going off the beaten path. Sagittarius isn't afraid to step away from the pack, and is a natural born leader who goes after what he or she wants, regardless of what other people think. Sagittarius is a born adventurer, and loves solo travel and exploration. Sagittarius also loves exploring the inner workings of their minds, and love stretching their horizons through a good book or movie.</p>

                    <p>Sagittarius is open-hearted, generous, and big-spirited, but Sagittarius is always truthful. Because of this, they may hurt others' feelings, or may be called out for not having tact or empathy. The latter is not true. With their keen imagination, Sagittarius is adept at putting themselves in another person's shoes—that's why so many Sagittarius are successful actors—but they do not feel the need to beat around the bush or lie. You can trust a Sagittarius to tell you what they really think. You can also trust a Sagittarius, period. Unlike other signs, they won't spill any secrets.</p>

                    <p>In bed and in relationships, Sags are adventurous and giving, able to adeptly try new things or break down barriers. In bed, Sags love trying new positions, new toys, and making everything an adventure. Yes to the lights on; yes to lovemaking outside. In relationships, Sags will be honest and true to themselves, and that may mean that they will move on from a relationship. If it's not working, it's not working, and a Sagittarius won't stay for the sake of another person's feelings. A Sagittarius will always be honest and in check with their emotions, and a Sagittarius will not engage in emotional blackmail.</p>

                    <p>Sagittarius is a steadfast friend and a creative thinker; a great person to have on a work team, as they have infectious energy and enthusiasm. They aren't looking for constant feedback, and can take a project and run with it. A Sag can also be an adept entrepreneur or CEO. A Sagittarius is smart, capable, and a true trailblazer.</p>

                <h2>Friendship Compatibilty</h2>
                <p>Sagittarius is loyal, loving, and the type of person you can feel has your back even if you've only known them for 24 hours. That said, a Sagittarius isn't interested in your drama, and doesn't have a lot of patience for friends who say one thing and do another. A Sagittarius is incredibly loyal, but won't hesitate to let you know if they see any faults or anything they feel you could be doing better. A Sagittarius collects friends, but may not be the best at keeping up. They like friendships IRL and in real time; they are great at reconnecting with after a decade or two lapse, and don't worry about the small things. In their mind, a long conversation is far better than a birthday card.</p>

            <div class="nocenter">
                <h2>Love Compatibilty</h2>
                <p>Ruled by expansive Jupiter, Sagittarius is big-hearted, open, and always looking beyond a checklist. A Sagittarius rarely has a “type,”— they are always intrigued by the individual, and don't make any assumptions about people until they've truly met and spoken with them.</p>

                <p>Sagittarius loves witty back and forths, but also appreciates the formality of the dating experience. While they are 100% honest in any situation, they love an excuse to dress up and check out cool date night locations. They would much rather go to an under the radar speakeasy than hang out at home, and love impressing you with their knowledge of, well, pretty much everything and anything.</p>

                <p>A Sagittarius is honest to a fault, and doesn't have a lot of patience for tears and emotions. They don't like what they perceive as emotional manipulation. They fight fair, but once a fight is over, they want it to be done—they do not like past mistakes brought up ad nauseum for days, weeks, or years down the line. A Sagittarius likes laying everything on the table, and some romantic partners may be frustrated by their cool logic, which trumps emotion every time. A Sagittarius expects their partner to continue to learn and grow throughout their lives, and truly seeks someone who they connect with on a soulful level.</p>
               
                <h2>Love Matches</h2>
                <p><span class="gold">Aries:</span> Passionate, intense, and energetic, Sagittarius and Aries have a play hard ethos where neither take anything too personally, and are always up for everything.
                </p>

                <p><span class="gold">Aquarius:</span> Independent, passionate, and adventurous, Aquarius and Sagittarius push each other to the limits—especially in bed. The two signs are all about maximum intensity.</p>

                <p><span class="gold">Leo:</span> Two fire signs, Leo and Sagittarius bring out the best in each other. Both are in awe of each other's strengths, and the two outgoing signs also love to entertain and hit the town—no Netflix and chill here!</p>

        <div class="facts">
            <div class="nocenter">
                <p><span class="gold">Best Gifts:</span> A passport holder, a backpack, or an Airbnb gift certificate. Saggitarius and travel are a cliche connection for a reason. Any gift to satisfy their wanderlust is sure to be a slam dunk.</p>

                <p><span class="gold">Best Spa Package:</span> Pedicure. An active Sagittarius is always on her feet, and appreciates a really good pedicure—maybe with some reflexology thrown in—and a pretty, polished shade of red. A pedicure is one indulgence a Sag will seek out anywhere in the world, and a reflexology treatment is what she needs to stay refreshed.</p>

                <p><span class="gold">Best Cocktail:</span> Whiskey, straight up. A Sagittarius doesn't play around when it comes to cocktails. They don't enjoy sugary-sweet syrups, and like the bitterness a whiskey brings to the table. They like sipping, savoring, and keeping their wits about them.</p>

                <h2>Social Life</h2>
                <p>Sagittarius has many friends from many parts of their lives, and prefers interacting with them one on one, or in small groups. When it comes to interactions, Sagittarius sometimes likes to play the “guest star” in different social groups. They may not go to a standing happy hour, but the invite is always open, and everyone is always happy to see them when they stop by. Sagittarius has a few very close friends from different areas of their lives, and tends to keep friendships forever. Sagittarius may not be the best at keeping in touch, but when you are able to reconnect with a Sag it is as if no time has passed.</p>               

                <h2>Best Vacations</h2>
                <p>Sagittarius loves exploring all corners of the globe, and prefers to have an “authentic” experience. They may turn up their noses at an all-inclusive resort, preferring to stay in an apartment or rental house to get a real feel of the culture of the area. A Sagittarius hates itineraries and prefers walking and feeling their way around a city. A Sagittarius has great intuition abroad, and loves the time and space to truly explore a city on their own time and terms.</p>

                <h2>Favorite Season</h2>
                <p>Sagittarius lives for slightly chilly cold late spring evenings; the times when dusk falls past nine PM and they can spend all day outdoors. Even though Sags love creature comforts, they find themselves feeling most in tune to their deepest selves while outdoors, preferably sitting around a fire. A Sagittarius loves looking up at the stars, and finds magical moments in the sweatshirt weather of late spring and early summer.</p>

        <div class="facts">
            <div class="nocenter">
                <p><span class="gold">Ailments:</span> Back aches and sciatic nerve problems. Sagittarius also controls the reproductive organs, so cramps and other issues are common.</p>
                <p><span class="gold">Strengths:</span> Physical strength—a Sag keeps on going, even when others call it quits.</p>
                <p><span class="gold">Weaknesses:</span>
                    Pushing beyond their breaking point. A Sagittarius person sometimes thinks that admitting pain is giving up, and will push far past the point of discomfort, which can sometimes backfire.</p>

                <h2>Fitness Routines</h2>
                <p>Fusion classes, like Piyo or Spin and Sculpt. Classes that combine skills keep you interested, and you love pushing your mental and physical limits.</p>

                <h2>About Backaches</h2>
                <p>It's not only the oversized backpack they'e likely to wear. Sagittarius often takes a lot on, and may push themselves beyond their breaking point. They may use the heaviest weights at the gym, do a double or triple workout, and may also express ascetism in certain situations —they are the ones who will always take the couch or sleep on the floor. When your back aches, it's a sign to slow down and honor your body. Your back is strong, Sagittarius, but you don't need to prove anything, and giving your body a break is a smart way.</p>               

                <h2>Healing Herbs for Intensity</h2>
                <p><span class="gold">Sage:</span> When a Sagittarius mind goes a million miles a minute, sage can help a Sagittarius keep track of everything on their to-do list.
                </p>
                <p><span class="gold">Basil:</span> Stress? Not here. Basil can help a Sagittarius mind from spiraling, and the herb can be especially helpful in calming a Sag down in a hurrty.</p>
                <p><span class="gold">Saffron:</span> This vibrant spice can help keep a Sagittarius feeling positive, optimistic, and buoyant, even in the face of adversity.</p>
                <p><span class="gold">Chervil:</span> A member of the parsley family, this herb can be helpful in respiratory issues, helpful for sporty Sags who may want to perform at the top of their game.</p>

        <div class="facts">
            <div class="nocenter">
                <h2>Work Style</h2>
                <p>Get it done! A Sag loves working on a laptop, and will pull it out in the most incongruous places. Laptop balanced on a treadmill? It's probably a Sag behind the screen. Sags love independence and thrive when their boss allows them to come and go as they please. They will get the work done, but they like having flexibility.</p>

                <p>Sags tend to procrastinate, and are experts at pulling through with a 24 hour miracle project. It's not that they don't plan ahead, it's that Sags thrive on adrenaline and love the high that comes from finishing a project in record time. You can always count on a Sag, but don't look over their shoulder or ask what their process may be.</p>

                <p>A Sag doesn't necessarily love becoming BFFs with their coworkers, and likes maintaining some professional distance. A Sag hates workplace drama, and prefers to get out of work on time and focus on their “real” life. A Sag is a fair boss who focuses on the work done by others; not office politics. A Sag wants what is best for their employees and knows that is often going home at a decent hour and enjoying their “real” lives.</p>

                <h2>Money</h2>
                <p>Sagittarius sees money as a tool, and they aren't necessarily attached to stockpiling money, and don't put a lot of stock into what they have in their bank accounts. This is a good and bad thing. While it's great to not be motivated by money, Sags have to eat, and Sags may need some prodding (and an appointment with a financial advisor) to actually get some financial systems in place.</p>

                <p>Sagittarius can easily come by money, and know they have a pretty robust set of skills that can always utilize to make money—or start their own business. A Sagittarius can always hustle and step things up when they need to, and may make or lose several fortunes in a lifetime. Because of the feast or famine Sag life, it can be helpful to make sure some safeguards, like investments, are in place, so that there's always some cash for a rainy day.</p>
