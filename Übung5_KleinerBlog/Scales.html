                    <h2>Libra Zodiac Sign Traits</h2>

                    <p>Intelligent, kind, and always willing to put others before themselves, Libras value harmony in all forms. Ruled by Venus, the planet of beauty, Libra adores a life that looks good. As the master of compromise and diplomacy, Libra is adept at seeing all points of view, and excels at crafting compromises and effecting mediation between others. This sign has a rich inner life yet loves other people, and they're always happiest with a large group of friends, family, and coworkers on whom they can count.</p>

                    <p>An air sign, Libra can often be "up in the clouds," and while he or she is amazing at making big plans, follow through can be tricky. Working with detail-oriented signs, like Virgos or Capricorns, can help Libras actually manifest their dreams into reality, especially in the workspace. But don't call out Librans for daydreaming—their imagination is one of their biggest assets, and they often put their imagination to work by finding careers in the arts or in literature.</p>

                    <p>Libras believe that they're directing their own lives, and they take a big-picture approach in making that life look and feel the best it can be. They spend a lot of time figuring out what's missing from that big picture, and they may feel unhappy if they become too focused on one thing, whether it's work, a partner, or a family member. Librans are at their best when they balance their schedule to include plenty of time for self-care rituals and personal pursuits, and when they give themselves enough flexibility to change focus.</p>

                    <p>When Libra falls in love, he or she falls hard, but this sign also recognizes that there's room for more than one grand love in his or her life. The Scales are pragmatic about love, realizing that different relationships often have different seasons. Librans can sometimes be accused of being too pragmatic, and they've been known to call off a relationship pre-emptively if they feel it may not work due to distance, age difference, or another external conflict.</p>

                    <p>Although Libra appears self-confident to outsiders, he or she might struggle with insecurity, especially as it relates to personal identity, which sometimes feels mutable. This sign's lifelong question is: "Who am I?" They may find their identity shifting based on where they are in their lives and who they're spending time with. In order to feel more confident in their identity, social Libras need to get comfortable spending time with themselves and getting to know their gut and their internal voice.</p>

                    <p>Libra is fiercely attracted to intelligence, which is just as important as appearance when it comes to the partners they end up falling for. This sign is all about cerebral connections—role-playing, dirty talk, and games in the bedroom all serve to amp up their interest. Physical connection is nice, but a sexy Snap can truly crank up a Libra's libido.</p>

                <h2>Friendship Compatibilty</h2>
                <p>Thanks to this sign's quick smile, sharp wit, and ability to make anyone feel like the most important person in the room, people are often surprised to find that the Libra they consider a "best friend" has about ten "best friends" just like them. Libras are adept at connecting to others quickly and love getting to know people. They also love socializing, entertaining, connecting friends to each other, and of course having parties and get-togethers. Libra also has a penchant for the spotlight and loves that bringing friends together for an event can help him or her shine, too.</p>

                <p>But even though Librans have dozens of friends from all areas of their lives, they sometimes have trouble connecting on a deeper level. Part of this is because Libra doesn't like feeling beholden to others and finds the intense emotional demands of deep friendships stifling. He or she prefers to flit, unencumbered, between different friends. This sign is also averse to conflict and finds it tough to be honest if they disagree with someone. They prefer to pull back. But when Libras do make a close friend, they keep that friend for life. They're not judgmental about others, collecting a diverse set of friends from different life circumstances and situations. For a Libra, there's always room for one more.</p>

                <h2>Love Compatibilty</h2>
                <p>Libra adores flirting, loves the drama and pageantry of romance, and is one of the few signs of the Zodiac that actually enjoys first dates. While Libras excel at charming potential partners, they have difficulty figuring out what they want, and all too often can get lost in the twists and turns of a relationship. Because of this, a Libra will sometimes hold back on falling in love, worried that partnership equals loss of self. Libra's partner has to be understanding if this sign seems to pull back. They should allow Libra the time and space to explore partnership on his or her own terms.</p>

                <p>While pragmatic Libras love romance, they're unlikely to rush into something. Instead, their rational side will weigh pros and cons, often thinking years into the future. A Libra will absolutely talk about future children, including what schools those kids-to-be will attend, and find these conversations with partners invaluable in helping to shape a rich life together.</p>

                <p>Librans want to please their partner, which can result in misunderstandings. Because this sign hates conflict, they may want their partner to always plan date nights. They certainly have ideas, but they're sensitive to criticism and worried that their partner may not enjoy what they've picked out. It's important for Libra to become an equal partner and realize that he or she isn't solely responsible for the other person's happiness (or lack thereof).</p>
                
                <p>A Libra hates conflict. Shouting and accusations frighten them. By sticking with "I feel" messages and making sure that your Libra feels loved even though you're angry right now, you'll go a long way toward making him or her feel safe about sharing feelings.</p>

                <p>A passionate sign, Libra needs physical and mental turn-ons. They love the slow burn of sexy back-and-forth texting and have an especially rich fantasy life. Tuning into that via role-play, dirty talk, and BDSM-style exploration can go a long way in keeping your Libra feeling hot, hot, hot.</p>

                <h2>Love Matches</h2>
                <p><span class="gold">Leo:</span> Fiery Leo falls hard for Libra, and Libra loves how Lions wear their heart on their sleeve. The two signs have an instant carnal connection, and Leo can help Libra take risks—including falling in love.</p>

                <p><span class="gold">Aquarius:</span> Adventurous and independent, Aquarius and Libra both get into a relationship with each other precisely because they don't "need" a partner—until they meet, spend time together, and discover that they can't live apart. Aquarius and Libra won't try to change each other. Instead, they're inspired by each other's different ways of approaching life.</p>

                <p><span class="gold">Sagittarius:</span>  Adventurous Archers entrance Libra because they don't worry about what other people think. By example, Libra learns how to stop being so indecisive, and also learns that passionate debates (okay, arguments) don't signify the end of a relationship. Sag can teach Libra how to fight, and the makeup sex is phenomenal.</p>

        <div class="facts">
            <div class="nocenter">
                <p><span class="gold">Best Gifts:</span> A cozy throw, comfy PJs, or slippers. Libra loves the Scandinavian concept of hygge, which means making the environment around them as cozy (and let's face it, as womblike) as possible.</p>

                <p><span class="gold">Best Spa Package:</span> A hot wrap body treatment. Libra loves feeling cocooned from head to foot with amazingly decadent lotions.</p>

                <p><span class="gold">Best Cocktail:</span> A mulled wine or hot toddy. A warm cocktail makes comfort-seeking Libra feel cozy and cared for like nothing else.</p>

                <h2>Social Life</h2>
                <p>A Libra loves socializing, and sees "social life" as interchangeable with "real life." Part of the meaning and joy that they find in their work is creating connections with coworkers, and this sign is often found helming the office social strategy. Libras are known for their "the more, the merrier" mentality, and they love connecting diverse groups of friends and family. They'll always say yes to an invitation, but they may spread themselves too thin. And while Libras might collect a large group of friendly acquaintances in their life, they may find it harder to cultivate true friends.</p>

                <p>This is partly because Librans hate conflict and may distance themselves from people at the first sign of friction. By learning that good friendships often become great because the relationship has weathered some sort of interpersonal storm, Libra can create a richer circle of friends. At the end of the day, this sign relishes a packed social schedule, always wants to have something on the calendar, and genuinely enjoys a party, even if they don't know very many (or anyone!) there.</p>

                <h2>Best Vacations</h2>
                <p>The Scales never want to go to the same place twice. They see frequent trips as essential for expanding their mind and perspectives. For a Libra, the more far-flung, the better. They love vacations that put them in the center of a completely different life. They don't want to be tourists—they want to get to know locals and fall into a local routine as soon as possible. For Libras, a sign of a successful trip is how many new people they've added to their contacts.</p>

                <h2>Favorite Season</h2>
                <p>Although their birthdays are in autumn, Libras are made for cozying up in front of the fire. Snow days, when the roads are closed and everyone is urged to hunker down, are one of this sign's favorite days—as long as they have their (very large) crowd of BFFs stranded beside them, ready to play board games, drink in front of the fire, and laugh together.</p>

        <div class="facts">
            <div class="nocenter">
                <p><span class="gold">Ailments:</span> Back pain</p>
                <p><span class="gold">Strengths:</span> Visualization</p>
                <p><span class="gold">Weaknesses:</span>
                    Short-term fixes. From downing caffeine-laden drinks to eating a ton of sugar, Libra often seeks energy in external, unhealthy ways, only to crash hard later.</p>

                <h2>Fitness Routines</h2>
                <p>Tennis, volleyball, adult soccer—Libra loves workout routines that are just as fun as they are calorie scorching. A Libra doesn't like to sweat it out solo at the gym. For this sign, the more, the merrier.</p>

                <h2>About Back Aches</h2>
                <p>This air sign rules the kidneys, ovaries, and lower back, making cramps common. Libras frequently finds themselves battling a vague ache in their lower back. This could be partly psychosomatic, the consequence of sitting in one place for too long, which is something that Libra often does on a psychic level. Because Librans so torn between decisions, they often end up doing nothing, "sitting" on any possibility—which manifests in an achy back.</p>

                <p>While alternative medicine treatments (including massage, acupuncture, and cupping) can be helpful, Libras should consider their back twinge as a prompt to just make a move. It doesn't matter if it's the "right" move—after a certain point, any move is better than sitting still. A Libra can also head to the gym and get moving in fun ways. Running, jumping, or joining a sports team can remind this sign that motion is positive, which can manifest in the way that they conduct their decision process.</p>

                <h2>Healing Herbs for Intensity</h2>
                <p><span class="gold">Catnip:</span> Just as it energizes kittens to play for hours, this herb, in either a tea or aromatherapy, can crank up Libra's energy while reducing anxiety and restlessness.</p>
                <p><span class="gold">Elderberry:</span> Brewed in a tea, this antioxidant can bring out Libra's natural beauty, especially in calming down skin.</p>
                <p><span class="gold">Bergamot:</span> Diffused as an essential oil, this herb can help sweep away Libra's tension and anxiety.</p>
                <p><span class="gold">St. John's Wort:</span> As a supplement or in a tea, St. John's wort can help with those minor aches, pains, and back twinges that Libra sometimes experiences.</p>

        <div class="facts">
            <div class="nocenter">
                <h2>Work Style</h2>
                <p>Libras think of their coworkers as friends, and they thrive in a low-drama atmosphere where they can trust and have fun with colleagues. This can be tough in more buttoned-up environments, so Libra can have a tough time navigating boundaries between coworkers or especially the people he or she manages. While this sign avoids workplace drama, they love talking about it, and consider every day their own personal soap opera.</p>

                <p>Creative Libras always try to make their job fun, and they'll sometimes find projects to do on their own if they're not feeling challenged enough. They bristle at rigidity, preferring to find their own way through their workload. For Libras, the big picture is far more important than the details, which means that they might lose steam halfway through a project—especially without a team member to hold them accountable and cheer them on.</p>

                <p>A Libra is drawn to careers that allow creative self-expression. He or she won't shy away from the spotlight and enjoys the perks of senior job title. The Scales will work hard on the job, and also to ensure that their team is happy. This may backfire for Libras in management if they take on someone else's work to be helpful—they might end up hurting themselves.</p>

                <h2>Money</h2>
                <p>While Libras love a paycheck, they sometimes have a hard time connecting their skills to making money. After all, a Libra often sees work as fun, so it can be tough for him or her to negotiate for a larger salary. This sign may be uncomfortable talking about the socially iffy topic of money, and they may have an exceptionally hard time bargaining or taking an active role in their money management. Luckily, Librans' innate smarts, resourcefulness, and charm keep the paychecks coming, and their love of luxury can help motivate them to speak up and ask for what they're worth.
