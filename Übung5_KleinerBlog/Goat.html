                    <h2>Capricorn Zodiac Sign Traits</h2>

                    <p>Smart, hardworking, and fully in control of their destiny, Capricorn signs will always get what they set their mind to, in both personal and professional life—no excuses. Capricorns may get a reputation as stubborn, but they simply know what they want, and also know how they wish other people would behave.</p>

                    <p>Natural rule-followers, Capricorns thrive on order and love strict rules, hierarchies, and set ways to do things. Can a Capricorn sign think outside the box? Yes, they can, but they prefer when they have strict boundaries to constrain against—free reign can make them feel paralyzed by choice. Capricorns are great at climbing the corporate ladder, and especially adept at making (and investing) money. Capricorns love family, and put a lot of stock in traditions. A Capricorn might stress themselves out trying to do everything perfectly—a Capricorn may feel like they must present a home-cooked meal every day, and would never admit to doing drive-thru or takeout. Capricorns believe presentation is everything, and their homes are usually Insta-worthy. A Capricorn sometimes is overly focused on what things look like, instead of how things feel, which could cause them to feel stifled and unhappy.</p>

                    <p>Capricorn needs to find a firm sense of self beyond how others perceive them, and recognize that racking up achievements is only one small part of their personality.</p>

                    <p>Capricorn signs are loyal friends, and have a funny and sly sense of humor when you get to know them—it is fun drawing them out of their shells. In love, Capricorn is a true partner, who is laser-focused on helping their partner find success and happiness. A Capricorn will dive into a relationship like a job, and believes that hard work can help make a bond as strong as possible. While sometimes a romantic conversation may veer toward feeling a bit like a board meeting, especially with action items and improvement plans, but if you roll with it, they have a point: Your bond will be stronger.</p>

                <h2>Friendship Compatibilty</h2>
                <p>Loyal, loving, and all about tradition, inside jokes, and the shared stories that make up friendship, Capricorn takes friendships incredibly seriously. They love taking care of their friends, and may make dinner, clean their closet, or use whatever their Capricorn strengths are to help make their friends lives better. Capricorn pushes their friends to the max, and isn't afraid to let their friends know if they are disappointed in their actions and behaviors. Capricorn will not let bad behavior go unnoticed, and will gently call out a friend who may have forgotten a birthday, complete with a reminder—like a gift of a calendar—to ensure it won't happen again. A Capricorn knows that they may not always be the “fun” friend—if they go on a friend trip or bachelor or bachelorette party, they want to be in bed by ten—but they also know that they bring some pretty great gifts to the table. A Capricorn inspires and challenges their friends, and expects the same in return.</p>

                <h2>Love Compatibilty</h2>
                <p>Ruled by strict Saturn, Capricorn knows, expects, and even relishes the tough parts of relationships. They are in it for the long haul, and know the best relationships have storms. It's not as if they are fatalistic—but Capricorn's love is realistic and they aren't going to have a rosy view of romance.</p>

                <p>That said, Capricorns are expansive and generous in love, and adore being wined and dined. They love the formality of early dating, and may be quite strict about following “the rules” of romance—even if those rules are made up. Typically, they may follow gender norms of dating, expecting the man to call first and the man to pay on the first date, but Capricorn isn't strict, and is always willing to consider another path or another way. Capricorns can be regimented, and love having a specific night of the week for date night. Capricorns thrive on routine, and may love staying at home on weekends, under the covers, with nothing but them and their lover. Capricorns love spending time only with their lover, especially in the early stages of a relationship, which can be frustrating to their friends and family.</p>

                <p>Capricorns are serious monogamists, and although they can be cautious in every other aspect of their lives, they are the sign who is likely to fall deeply in love with someone, and it's not unusual for a Capricorn to get married after only several months of dating. They know their hearts well, and don't hesitate to lock things down when they know that the relationship is right. And their instincts are on point—loyal Capricorns stay in relationships for the long haul. They aren't afraid of therapy if their relationship needs help, and approach problems as a bump in the road, capable of fixing with honesty, trust, and hard work from both partners.</p>
               
                <h2>Love Matches</h2>
                <p><span class="gold">Taurus:</span> These two earth signs are anchored in friends and family, have clear goals, and are good at taking the steps achieved to reach them. These two earth signs are also passionate within the confines of their relationship—they may not have earth-shattering first date sex, but will have incredible sex for decades to come.
                </p>
                
                <p>These two signs understand each other deeply and share the same life goals and values. When it comes to priorities, Capricorn and Taurus hold security and financial matters at the top of their list. They bring out the best in each other, and with Taurus so devoted and Capricorn so loyal, you can be confident in a lasting relationship.</p>

                <p><span class="gold">Virgo:</span> Serious, loyal, and committed, these two signs are all about passion in predictability. What's wrong with a standing Saturday date night if it leads to explosive sex later, guaranteed? These two signs result in an earthy, solid bond filled with respect and long-term commitment.</p>

                <p>Logic and common sense are hard at work in a Capricorn-Virgo relationship, and both are smart with it comes to money, kids, and life at home. Rationality plays a key role in their relationship, and while they don't let their emotions get the better of them, sensibility may stifle passion.</p>

                <p><span class="gold">Pisces:</span> Dreamy Pisces can help Capricorn learn to love their imagination, and Capricorn can help Pisces get their heads out of the clouds and back to reality. There is never a dull moment with these two signs, and their commitment and love to each other ensures they stay together.</p>

                <p>A Capricorn-Pisces relationship often begins as a friendship. It may take a while for Capricorn to understand and accept Pisces' sometimes lazy, lackadaisical ways, but Pisces doesn't always quickly warm to Capricorn's tendency to shut them out, either. But with a mutual agreement, these two can take time for each other and establish a prosperous relationship.</p>

        <div class="facts">
            <div class="nocenter">
                <p><span class="gold">Best Gifts:</span> Candles! Candles make a house a home, and even though Capricorn is a minimalist, they can't resist eco-friendly soy candles in muted colors, that are often lit everywhere in the house.</p>

                <p><span class="gold">Best Spa Package:</span> Manicure. Buffed, polished, with plenty of hand lotion, Capricorns are never without neat hands, and love low-key luxury. The color they choose may be nude or clear, but both male and female Caps love having elegant fingers.</p>

                <p><span class="gold">Best Cocktail:</span> Pinot grigio. A simple white wine, sipped and savored over the course of the meal, is usually what a Capricorn appreciates. But sparkling water is also a close second—Caps don't like to lose control, and may save imbibing for (very) special occasions.</p>

                <h2>Social Life</h2>
                <p>Capricorn has a set, small group of friends, and the friends they have now may well be friends they made when they were toddlers. Capricorns truly believe in the power of lifelong friendship, and love having a very small circle of friends they have a long history with, who they trust implicitly. Capricorns tend to prefer doing things one on one or in small groups, and don't love going to parties. Capricorns can be hard to get to know, but once you have one in your inner circle, you have a friend for life. Capricorns are so intense and busy in their lives that they are often happy to spend downtime by themselves—they're not lonely, they're recharging.</p>               

                <h2>Best Vacations</h2>
                <p>Capricorn loves self-improvement, so any vacation with that element is an A plus in their book. Capricorns are big on wellness retreats, and love the idea of learning a new skill while they are on vacation. A cooking class in the South of France, for example, is a great way for Capricorns to learn while indulging—the best of both worlds for a Capricorn.</p>

                <h2>Favorite Season</h2>
                <p>Even though their birthdays are in the dead of winter, Capricorns love summer, and love camping, hiking, and spending all night under the stars. Capricorns can be fastidious, and can bring camping to the next level, but being in nature can help tame Capricorn's intensity. Capricorns love spending days outside soaking up Vitamin D and will always choose to have a meal outside rather than in if there is any sort of option.</p>

            <div class="nocenter">
                <p><span class="gold">Ailments:</span>  Knee pain is common; ACL injuries can often be seen in Capricorns. In addition, Capricorns show their stress on their skin, and breakouts, eczema, and rashes are unfortunately all too common.</p>
                <p><span class="gold">Strengths:</span> Sheer force of will. Capricorns will not accept physical limitations, and often drive their doctors crazy by not following.</p>
                <p><span class="gold">Weaknesses:</span>
                    Capricorns can sometimes get annoyed at their body, and may need to really learn how to focus on tuning into their body and what it needs. Mind-body awareness can help keep certain physical ailments at bay, and more importantly, can help Caps catch a problem before it becomes a major issue.</p>

                <h2>Fitness Routines</h2>
                <p>SLT classes. A combination of cardio and Pilates, SLT keeps your heart pumping, your mind engaged, and the mental stamina it takes can make it feel more like meditation—which is just what you need.</p>

                <h2>About Skin Flare Ups</h2>
                <p>Capricorns have a ton of skin products, can recommend them to others better than any employee at a makeup counter, and can have complicated clinical discussions with their dermatologists, but they also seem to struggle with flare ups, despite their knowledge and skincare routine. What gives? Why do Capricorns have skin issues? The answer lies in the mind-body connection, or lack of it. Capricorns are experts at keeping their emotions to themselves, but they have to come out somewhere, and it's often via the skin. In addition, Capricorns can stress themselves, and their skin, out. Capricorns are such creatures of habit that small deviations, like eating a different selection of food than they're used to, can cause skin eruptions. Capricorns should stick to what works, routine wise, and working with a dermatologist and recognizing triggers, including emotional ones, can help Caps stay on top of any skin issues that may come up in their lives.</p>               

                <h2>Healing Herbs for Intensity</h2>
                <p><span class="gold">Rosemary:</span> Not only can this herb help soothe aching joints, it can also give mental clarity to Capricorns.
                </p>
                <p><span class="gold">Tarragon:</span> Caps sometimes feel their brain spinning, especially when it's time to go to sleep. Tarragon can help them calm down and get some much needed rest.</p>
                <p><span class="gold">Marjoram:</span> This spice can help a Cap snap out of a bad mood and can help them continually see the bright side and remember that tomorrow is always another day.</p>
                <p><span class="gold">Chamomile:</span> Like tarragon, chamomile can help calm the overactive mind of a Capricorn. In addition, chamomile is an anti-inflammatory, which is very important to sporty Caps.</p>

                <h2>Work Style</h2>
                <p>Slow, steady, and methodical, a Capricorn is dependable in the office, and is often first in and last out. A Capricorn never waits until the last minute, and it's not unusual for a Capricorn to begin a project the day it's assigned.</p>

                <p>A Capricorn seems to be able to take it all on, and gravitates toward careers, like law or finance, where the pressure is on. Capricorn thrives under pressure, and loves the challenge of seeing just how much they can fit in a 24 hour day. Capricorns are very good at setting boundaries, and don't let emotion get in the way of their work life. A Capricorn is a fair, exacting boss, who expects their reports to be just as hardworking as they are. Personal excuses don't go far with Capricorns, and they truly just want to see the work done, and done well.</p>

                <p>Capricorn can get frustrated when peers don't seem to work as hard, yet sail ahead, and sometimes get stuck on work projects that require imagination or out of the box thinking. Art classes, or other creative pursuits outside the office can help them achieve these soft skills, which can help their supervisors see them as the rockstars they are.</p>

                <p>Capricorns are adept at office politics, and never have a problem finding or keeping a job. They get a lot out of their employment, and see work as one avenue to find meaning and purpose in their lives and world.</p>

                <h2>Money</h2>
                <p>Capricorn is good at making money and excellent at saving money. They have a keen mind for investments, and genuinely love putting aside money for a rainy day. A Capricorn knows the value of a dollar, and loves couponing and saving money, even if they don't “need” to do so. A Capricorn may comparison shop for ages until they finally bite the bullet and buy a product, and a Capricorn doesn't like spending unnecessary money, and may need to be coaxed into spending money on luxuries—and for a Capricorn, even a coffee bought out is a luxury.</p>

                <p>A Capricorn is good at investments, and may see it as a hobby. That said, Capricorns may need to be coaxed into contributing financially to charity; something that they genuinely enjoy once they actually open their wallet.</p>

                <p>A Capricorn is good at negotiating, but while they are great making money in a corporate setting, they may not be as entrepreneurial as other signs, because they don't want to take a risk, and they don't want to put their own money into their ideas. This may limit their financial possibility. Learning to take smart financial risks can be a very good lesson for cautious Capricorn.</p>
