                    <h2>Taurus Zodiac Sign Traits</h2>

                    <p>Smart, ambitious, and trustworthy, Taurus is the anchor of the Zodiac. Amazing friends,
                        colleagues, and partners, Taureans value honesty above all else and are proud that their
                        personal relationships tend to be drama free. Bulls get the reputation of being stubborn, but
                        they're not always stuck in their ways. This searching sign is willing to see another point of
                        view, but they won't flip-flop on an opinion just to make someone else happy. They will shift
                        their thinking only if they truly have a change of heart.</p>

                    <p>With a rep as one of the hardest-working signs in the Zodiac, a Bull is never afraid to roll up
                        those sleeves and get to work, and won't blink an eye at pulling an all-nighter to get the job
                        done. But it's not all work for a Taurus sign. Anchored by the earth, this passionate sign is
                        all about sensuality, and is always seeking out pleasure. Whether they're indulging in luxurious
                        massages, spending hours in bed with their lover, or going on a long run, Taureans love feeling
                        present in their body and frequently need to get in touch with their physical self.</p>

                    <p>When it comes to love, Taureans are all about honesty, which is why a first date with a Bull may
                        resemble a job interview. They're not being rude—they're built for partnerships and are simply
                        trying to see if you're a good fit at the start. And once you begin dating a Taurus, forget
                        about white lies. A Taurus would much rather hear that an outfit is unflattering than endure
                        hollow compliments. Taurus will hold a grudge against someone who lies, even if it's a lie just
                        to make them feel happy. In bed, Taurus is a giving lover—as long as their partner steps it up
                        and makes sure to give as well as receive pleasure! Detail-oriented Taurus may seem nitpicky
                        (even in the bedroom, a mid-romp critique may not be unusual), but that's not because they want
                        to offend. They simply demand the best, and they expect the people in their life to deliver.</p>

                    <p>While Taurus signs have an intense internal drive, they sometimes have trouble respecting
                        authority, especially if asked to do something they think is pointless or should be done
                        differently. Learning to be flexible and go with the flow can be an advantage to Taurus. And
                        while Taureans have a rich internal life, they value external attributes and may overlook
                        someone who doesn't have the perfect outfit, car, or resume. Learning the benefits of getting to
                        know someone before writing them off can be a lifelong lesson to a Taurean, especially in love,
                        where they might be too hasty to write off a perfect match.</p>

                <h2>Friendship Compatibilty</h2>
                <p>"Friends forever" is a cliché probably dreamed up by a Taurus. When it comes to friendship, once
                    you're in with a Bull, you're in for life. Bulls aren't just loyal, they're also fun, with a witty
                    streak that always keeps you laughing. They don't take friendship lightly, and remember birthdays,
                    anniversaries, and other key events, often with a card or gifts. But it can be tough to get into a
                    Taurus' inner circle. For one, they can be suspicious of outsiders, and may assume that someone has
                    an agenda. Be honest with Taurus—they hate lies (even "you look amazing" white lies) and are
                    suspicious of people who flatter them too much. Be real—disagreeing (respectfully!) with a Taurus
                    and prompting a debate can go a long way toward becoming BFFs.</p>

        <div class="facts">
            <div class="nocenter">
                <h2>Love Compatibilty</h2>
                <p>Ruled by Venus, a Taurus in love is sensual to the max and very connected to their physical bodies. A
                    Taurus must feel physical attraction from the start if a romance is going to take off. But those who
                    want to seduce Taurus first have to get past the formidable external barriers this sign places in
                    front of them. Bulls won't let anyone see their inner life, and they may seem a little formal and
                    standoffish until you prove your true worth.</p>

                <p>Rather than flirting, Taurus prefers a real conversation to trading pleasantries or jokes. And forget
                    about trying to figure out what Taurus wants you to say. This sign senses when you're not being
                    genuine, and nothing is more of a turn-off.</p>

                <p>But even though Taurus may seem placid when you meet in a social setting, all bets are off behind
                    closed doors. Sensual Taurus connects best via physical sensations, and is all about pushing
                    boundaries when they're with someone they trust.</p>

                <h2>Love Matches</h2>
                <p><span class="gold">Virgo:</span> Fellow earth signs, Virgo and Taurus are a couple that stays away
                    from drama—and stays together forever. These two signs may not be showy with their emotions, but
                    they have an almost psychic connection, and each knows exactly what the other needs—sometimes even
                    before their partner knows. The two signs love beauty and are all about creating a partnership
                    that's as lovely on the outside as it is on the inside.</p>

                <p><span class="gold">Pisces:</span> Imaginative and emotional, Pisces can pull Taurus out of their
                    shell and help them tune into their emotions. Taurus, in turn, can help ground Pisces and keep their
                    relationship drama-free. In a love affair, these two signs are generally a happy union with deep
                    empathy for each other.</p>

                <p><span class="gold">Capricorn:</span> This cardinal sign has the ambition to match Taurus'
                    persistence. Together, this duo gets things done. A Capricorn life partner may also be a great
                    business partner; Taurus loves the idea of being with someone whom they can trust and depend on in
                    all aspects of their lives.</p>
            </div>

        <label for="lifestyle">Lifestyle</label>
        <div class="facts">
            <div class="nocenter">
                <p><span class="gold">Best Gifts:</span> The newest tech toy pleases the Bull's drive for getting (and
                    inputting) as much data as possible about their lives. Taurus also loves luxury and can't resist a
                    high-end box of chocolates or something special from a high-end boutique. Finally, Bulls love
                    getting out in nature and are happy with any hiking accessories that let them explore the earth.</p>

                <p><span class="gold">Best Spa Package:</span> A long massage or pampering pedicure. Taureans can't get
                    enough physical touch.</p>

                <p><span class="gold">Best Cocktail:</span> A Moscow Mule or gin and tonic—with extra limes, please.
                    Stiff drinks match the Bulls work-hard, play-hard mentality, but a Taurean can't resist presentation
                    and loves the copper-mug allure of a Moscow Mule.</p>

                <h2>Social Life</h2>
                <p>A Bull's social circle is likely to include a few friends they met in kindergarten, because once
                    Taurus decides that someone is worth including in their life, they're friends forever. Bulls love
                    spending time in a small social circle of friends they know; they can feel claustrophobic at a club
                    or packed bar. When it comes to weekend relaxation, Taureans love balance. They love socializing but
                    also self-improvement, and they think nothing of spending a few weekend hours catching up on work
                    projects.</p>

                <h2>Best Vacations</h2>
                <p>Can you say spa-aah? This work-hard, play-hard sign is all about well-earned R&R and loves spending
                    an entire day camped out under a beach umbrella at an exotic resort. The hotel is part of the
                    adventure, too, and a Taurean takes notice (and delights!) in high thread count sheets, rain
                    showerheads, and plenty of room service options. While Taurus will happily go on an adventure travel
                    vacation, where they'll take the lead on a twelve-mile hike or kayak for hours, they like knowing
                    there's a cozy, private room at the end of the journey.</p>

                <h2>Favorite Season</h2>
                <p>Even though Taurus is born at the end of spring, they love the cozy-up-under-the-covers feeling of
                    winter. The Bull isn't afraid of snow or cold, and loves the feeling of fresh air and wind on their
                    face. For a Taurus, a day outdoors followed by a night by the fire, hopefully cuddled skin-on-skin
                    with their favorite plus one under a cozy blanket, is pretty much perfect. And forget about dreary
                    days; Taureans see the sometimes-dull days of winter as an ideal time to hunker down and finish a
                    project.</p>
            </div>

        <label for="health">Health</label>
        <div class="facts">
            <div class="nocenter">
                <p><span class="gold">Ailments:</span> Sore throats</p>
                <p><span class="gold">Strengths:</span> Determination</p>
                <p><span class="gold">Weaknesses:</span>
                    Belief that taking medicine is giving up and seeing a doctor is a sign of failure. Stubborn Bulls
                    sometimes have a hard time accepting medical advice and may try DIY cures or just ignoring the
                    problem away.</p>

                <h2>Fitness Routines</h2>
                <p>Taurus thrives on routine and loves going to the same classes, where they have their spot, their
                    instructor, and a sense of exactly how the class will unfold. Taurus also thrives on a challenge and
                    loves evidence they're getting better. Signing up for a race and using a fitness tracker are great
                    ways to keep a Taurus moving. The Bull always feels good after a sweat session, but getting them
                    motivated can be tough, so easy strategies to get moving are always welcome.</p>

                <h2>About Sore Throats</h2>
                <p>Ruled by the throat, Taurus may find sore throats and colds dragging them down—especially when they
                    find themselves "swallowing" their truth to fit in. While a sore throat is worth a doctor visit,
                    Bulls should check in with their emotions when they're under the weather. Sometimes, not speaking up
                    or holding back can lead to getting sick. Finally, Bulls don't win a prize for suffering—if you feel
                    sick, take a sick day!</p>

                <h2>Healing Herbs for Intensity</h2>
                <p><span class="gold">Mint:</span> Not only is this a helpful herb for clearing up coughs and colds,
                    which frequently plague Bulls, but the refreshing aroma can improve memory and raise alertness,
                    which are key for keeping a Taurus' head in the game after hours of work.</p>
                <p><span class="gold">Thyme:</span> The invigorating scent is key for lifting mood and for making Bulls
                    feel more energetic—great after a long weekend.</p>
                <p><span class="gold">Violet:</span> The pretty purple blossoms can make a great, throat-calming tea,
                    helpful for Taureans.</p>
                <p><span class="gold">Catnip:</span> As an herb for indigestion, catnip is a perfect first step for
                    Bulls, whose love of luxury sometimes leads them to overindulge.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <input type="radio" id="business" name="tabs">
        <label for="business">Career and Money</label>
        <div class="facts">
            <div class="nocenter">
                <h2>Work Style</h2>
                <p>Bulls are amazing project managers, able to conceptualize an idea, break it down into parts and suss
                    out who can best do what. This sign isn't looking for the glory and hates office politics. A Taurus
                    would much prefer a day of checking things off their to-do list to spending hours in endless
                    meetings, and they inwardly roll their eyes whenever workplace conversation turns to gossip.</p>

                <p>Taurus is a smart, well-respected leader who is great at delegating and giving credit when others
                    deserve it. Taureans may not be the flashiest bosses, but they lead by example. They can be
                    incredibly creative when given the time and opportunity to do so, and they're uniquely talented at
                    bringing their brainstorm to fruition at work. They are also diligent. That coworker who's the first
                    one in and last one out in the office is likely a Taurus. Bulls are team players, and will do
                    whatever it takes to get the job done. This is great when all team members are on the same page,
                    less great when other coworkers take advantage of Taurus' natural lend-a-hand attitude.</p>

                <h2>Money</h2>
                <p>Bulls love luxury, but they also love to feel secure, so they make sure that they have the funds to
                    pay for their splurge before whipping out the plastic. Logic and numbers appeal to that rational
                    Taurus brain, so they enjoy balancing budgets and setting up investment accounts. Since Taureans
                    know what they're worth and what they deserve, they won't let emotion cloud the picture when it's
                    time to negotiate or ask for a promotion or raise. In general, Bulls are often described as "good
                    with money" and recognize their hard work to get anything they have.</p>
