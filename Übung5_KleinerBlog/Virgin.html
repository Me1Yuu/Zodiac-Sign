                    <h2>Virgo Zodiac Sign Traits</h2>

                    <p>Smart, sophisticated, and kind, Virgo gets the job done without complaining. Virgos are amazing friends, always there to lend a hand and also lend advice. Practical Virgos are incredibly adept at big picture thinking, and planning out their life, their vacations, and what they're going to do today isn't a drag it makes them feel in control and secure.</p>

                    <p>Virgo has a rich inner life, and can sometimes seem shy at first meeting. A Virgo won't spill secrets right away, and it's important to earn a Virgo's trust. But once you do, that Virgin will be a friend for life. And if you think that you're dating a shy Virgo, trust that those walls will fall down in the bedroom. One of the most passionate signs, Virgos specialize at connecting to their physicality, and this earth sign loves and celebrates physical connection with their partner.</p>

                    <p>Virgos expect perfection from themselves, and they may project those high standards on the other people in their life. A Virgo hates when someone lets him or her down, even if it's minor and unavoidable, like a last-minute cancellation. Virgo signs never want to disappoint the people in their lives, so they may spread themselves too thin put themselves last.</p>

                    <p>Virgo signs love and are inspired by beauty. They consider what they wear and how they decorate their house to be an extension of their personality. They thrive when everything in their life looks Pinterest-perfect, and although their friends make fun of their penchant for organizing, it truly is the anchor that makes Virgo's life run smoothly.</p>

                    <p>Intelligent and a lifelong learner, Virgo loves trying new things, reading books, and learning about the world. They'll happily sign up for an adult-education course, and they consider an afternoon in bed with a book pretty much ideal. A Virgo prefers an evening with good friends to a huge party, and values downtime just as much as socializing. This sign doesn't need to fill their calendar to be content.</p>

                <h2>Friendship Compatibilty</h2>
                <p>Don't be offended if Virgo turns down the first invite you extend although Virgos are kind and friendly to everyone, they may have some walls around them, built to protect themselves and the circle of friends they already have. This sign takes friendship very seriously, and is also very good at putting themselves (and their energy reserves) first. That's why Virgos won't take on a friend that they don't think they'd be able to sustain. So while Virgo is happy to confab in the locker room before a gym class, it may be years before he or she finally says yes to that coffee after class invite.</p>

                <p>Once you have a Virgo friend, you have a friend for life. They can also be your conscience, happy to give an opinion and letting you know if you're not doing your best. Virgos demands excellence from everyone in their lives (especially their friends), and they're quick to point out if they don't think you're living up to your potential. Because Virgo chooses friends carefully, he or she respects the "friend" label and expects you to do the same. A Virgo hates when friends cancel last minute, and this sign is only interested in friends on whom they can rely.</p>

            <div class="nocenter">
                <h2>Love Compatibilty</h2>
                <p>Virgo loves hard, and is always in pursuit of star love the kind where souls, minds, and bodies seamlessly merge. That's why this sign sometimes gets the (unfair) reputation of being too picky. They're not they just know exactly what they're looking for, and know that settling for someone good enough will mean that they'll never find the love that their body and soul crave.</p>

                <p>Even when they find someone who might fulfill that role in their lives, Virgos may still be cagey. That's because this sign is innately wired to protect their hearts. During the initial courtship, which may feel like it's taking forever, Virgo is watching his or her potential partner's every move. They want to make sure that this person will live up to the ideal image that they're crafting in their mind, and a wrong move (like being rude to a waiter) will cause Virgo to cross this candidate off the list.</p>

                <p>However, once Virgos give their heart, they give everything. They expect absolute honesty and give the same in return. A Virgo truly believes that partnership means "what's mine is yours," and this sign elevates a partnership above all else. Because Virgos believe in lifelong love, a breakup or betrayal can be particularly devastating.</p>
                
                <p>Virgo may seem a bit buttoned-up in public, but they love sex they see it as a celebration of their partnership and a commitment to their partner. They cherish the physical aspects of their relationship and are not happy if they don't have that, even for a few days. Making plenty of physical contact, including morning kisses and long evening embraces, massages, and time in the sheets, is key to keeping your Virgo happy.</p>

                <h2>Love Matches</h2>
                <p><span class="gold">Taurus:</span> Two earth signs, Taurus and Virgo innately get each other, and they believe that drama takes away from partnership. These two signs are happy to swap social media passwords; each knows that the other has nothing to hide.</p>

                <p><span class="gold">Cancer:</span> Think of the line where the beach and the sea converge that watery space where sand and ocean are impossible to separate is emblematic of the Cancer/Virgo bond. These signs are nearly psychically intertwined, and their physical connection is pretty out of this world.</p>

                <p><span class="gold">Capricorn:</span> Practical Caps and grounded Virgos agree on so much in life they have a plan, they pursue excellence, and they're happy to avoid drama however possible. But they're anything but boring. Because these two signs understand each other, they can help each other be their best and they're unstoppable in the bedroom.</p>

        <div class="facts">
            <div class="nocenter">
                <p><span class="gold">Best Gifts:</span> Fresh flowers, luxe candles, and elegant photo frames. For Virgos, presentation is everything, and they can't resist a pretty package.</p>

                <p><span class="gold">Best Spa Package:</span> For Virgos, mani/pedis are practically religion even for men. A full set of super-polished digits makes Virgo feel pretty and powerful.</p>

                <p><span class="gold">Best Cocktail:</span> A vodka soda. This drink is clean, precise, and easily Instagrammable as long as the lime is cut just so.</p>

                <h2>Social Life</h2>
                <p>Virgos are adept at socializing in a variety of settings, and they're charming to new people, but all of this takes a toll on their energy. While many people want to become Virgo's friend, this sign is extremely choosy about who they let into their social circle, and they have a less-is-more attitude when it comes to friends. Virgins are happy meeting up with a few key people for a glass of wine or a movie night, and they prefer to skip large parties. They keep their friends for life, and their social circle is usually made up of people they've known since childhood. Virgos are extremely invested in their relationships, including the romantic ones, and once they do find a partner, they cherish their one-on-one time, and may eschew invitations involving larger groups.</p>

                <h2>Best Vacations</h2>
                <p>This cerebral sign adores getting to know new cultures, and couldn't be happier than when they're roaming the streets of an unfamiliar city, looking for the best latte. While Virgos won't say no to the beach (they do love warm weather), that beach vacation needs to be interspersed with culture. A Virgo finds museums relaxing, and is usually the type who wants to read every single plaque on every single display.</p>

                <h2>Favorite Season</h2>
                <p>Born in late August and early September, Virgos are obsessed with #sweaterseason. They love the fresh start of fall and, as lifelong learners, still get a thrill from back-to-school season, even if it's been years since they were inside a classroom. Virgo tends to get lethargic in summer and hates being stuck indoors during the winter.</p>

                <p><span class="gold">Ailments:</span> Nervous stomachs</p>
                <p><span class="gold">Strengths:</span> Physical fitness</p>
                <p><span class="gold">Weaknesses:</span>
                    Boutique gym classes. Virgo loves the adrenaline rush of an intense class, often taking classes back to back. They also adore boutique classes with individualized instruction, which may do a number on their bank account.</p>

                <h2>Fitness Routines</h2>
                <p>Pilates and barre classes allow Virgos to use their intense focus on their body, which lets them to take a break from whatever else is on their mind. Not only do Virgos love the long, lean look that a barre class gives them, they also love focusing on subtle improvements as well as the idea that they can always do better the next day.</p>

                <h2>About Nervous Stomachs</h2>
                <p>This earth sign rules the abdominal region, which explains why Virgo always experiences a nervous stomach before a big event. They can get physically sick when they're emotionally upset. The upside: Virgo has learned from an early age how to trust their gut literally. Virgos is tuned into those butterflies, and by paying attention to how their stomachs feel, they can avoid bad situations. In the interim, eating healthy, fresh foods, avoiding processed snacks, not drinking too much caffeine, and working out can help even out how they feel.</p>

                <h2>Healing Herbs for Intensity</h2>
                <p><span class="gold">Mint:</span> This soothing scent or flavor, whether on its own, in tea, or in shampoo or lotion, is simultaneously calming and invigorating. Mint turns Virgo's anxiety into excitement to face any challenges in the day ahead.</p>
                <p><span class="gold">Dill:</span> Mixed in salads, this antioxidant herb can reduce cramps and help with digestion, which are both key for Virgos who often deal with abdominal aches and pains.</p>
                <p><span class="gold">Rosemary:</span> Consuming or smelling this memory aid can help Virgos tap into their inner strength by reminding them of all the ways in which they excel, and of all the people who have their back.</p>
                <p><span class="gold">Caraway:</span> This herb, which is beneficial for skin, hair, and emotional health, is ideal for keeping Virgos grounded, staving off minor aches and pains, and igniting their inner glow.</p>

                <h2>Work Style</h2>
                <p>Virgos love work, especially throwing themselves into a project. A Virgo can be a quiet leader, motivating a team without big lectures or announcements, and leading by example instead. This sign demands just as much (if not more) excellence from themselves as they do from the people who work with them.</p>

                <p>While Virgo is a good team player who doesn't cause drama or make waves, this sign loves working solo, often burning the midnight oil just to have some thinking time alone in the office. Virgo hates multi-tasking, and finds endless emails and interruptions to be incredibly invasive. Because of this, Virgos often take their work home with them, which can be annoying to the people they live with.</p>

                <p>This intelligent sign thrives in careers that don't demand 9-5 attendance, and that let them be their own motivator and boss. Remote careers attract Virgo, as well as careers in the education sector, where they can share their passion for knowledge yet have the time and space to work on their own projects.</p>

                <h2>Money</h2>
                <p>Intelligent and rational, Virgo has a rep for being good at saving money. And they are most of the time. But with impulsive Mercury as their ruling planet, sometimes Virgos just want to spend. This sign absolutely enjoys working hard for hard work's sake, but they're also fond of the comfort that a paycheck provides. And while Virgo doesn't care what others think and never buys something to impress others, he or she tends to have expensive taste. Virgo also loves to splurge on travel and can't resist a plane ticket or luxe hotel. Ultimately, though, Virgos temper their spending with smart savings strategies, coupled with their ability to parlay that big intelligence into a big paycheck.</p>
